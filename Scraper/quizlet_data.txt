Red blood cells have a disk-like shape and lose their membranous organelles, like mitochondria and nuclei, during maturation. Erythrocytes thus cannot multiply on their own and are anaerobic. Their main role is the transport of oxygen to the tissues and of the carbon dioxide to the lungs; this task is accomplished through the use of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen and limited amount of carbon dioxide.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the correct sequence of a cardiac impulse?\", \"_choices\": [\"SA node - AV node - Purkinje fibers - bundle of His - ventricles\", \"AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - SA node - ventricles - atria\", \"SA node - atria - AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles\", \"SA node - AV node - atria - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles\"], \"_answer\": \"C.\\n-An ordinary cardiac contraction originates in, and is regulated by, the sinoatrial (SA) node. The impulses travel through both atria, stimulating them to contract simultaneously. The impulse then arrives at the atrioventricular (AV) node, which momentarily slows conduction, allowing for completion of atrial contraction and ventricular filling. The impulse is then carried by the bundle of His, which branches into the right and left bundle branches and through the Purkinje fibers in the walls of both ventricles, generating a strong contraction.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Hemoglobin's affinity for Oxygen (O2):\", \"_choices\": [\"increases in exercising muscle tissue.\", \"decreases as blood pH increases.\", \"decreases as blood pH decreases.\", \"is higher in maternal blood than in fetal blood.\"], \"_answer\": \"C.\\n-According to the Bohr effect, decreasing pH in the blood decreases hemoglobin's affinity for O2. A decrease in pH of the blood generally occurs during heavy exercise, when the muscles produce a lot of lactic acid. This decreased affinity for O2 facilitates the unloading of O2 to tissues in need. Hemoglobin's affinity for O2 is higher in fetal blood than in adult blood.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following correctly traces the circulatory pathway?\", \"_choices\": [\"Superior vena cava - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary artery - lungs - pulmonary veins - left atrium - left ventricle - aorta.\", \"Superior vena cava - left atrium - left ventricle - pulmonary artery - lungs - pulmonary veins - right atrium - right ventricle - aorta.\", \"Aorta - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary artery - lungs - pulmonary veins - left atrium - left ventricle - superior vena cava.\", \"Superior vena cava - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary veins - lungs - pulmonary artery - left atrium - left ventricle - aorta.\"], \"_answer\": \"A. \\n-Blood drains from the superior vena cava into the right atrium. It passes through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, and then through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It flows through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.

Their role is to prevent backflow of blood into the atria. The valve on the right side of the heart has three cusps and is called the tricuspid valve. As such, it prevents backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium. The valve on the left side of heart has two cusps and is called the bicuspid or mitral valve.

The osmotic pressure of the surrounding tissue remains constant. However, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end is greater than the hydrostatic pressure at the venous end. As a result, fluid moves out of the capillaries at the arterial end and back in a the venous end.

Choice (A) is incorrect because arteries are thick walled and veins are thin walled. Choice (B) is also incorrect; this relationships is reversed in pulmonary circulation. Choice (D) is opposite.

Both arteries and veins have a thin endothelial lining.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is involved in the body's primary blood-buffering mechanism?\", \"_choices\": [\"Fluid intake\", \"Absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal system\", \"Carbon dioxide produced from metabolism\", \"Reabsorption in the kidney\"], \"_answer\": \"C.\\n-Carbon dioxide is a by-product of metabolism in cells, which later combines with water to form bicarbonate in a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase.

If it has an area of 20 m2, we can see that a force of 5000 N over the surface area gives a pressure of 5000 / 20 = 250 N/m2 minimum required to lift the airfoil. This means that the pressure below the airfoil must be at least 250 N/m2 greater than the pressure above the airfoil.

Of the three listed, fluorine is the closest element to the upper-right in the Periodic Table. The first ionization energy measures the difficulty in removing a valence electron. Because of fluorine's position and inherent electronegativity, it is very difficult to remove one of its valence electrons. Thus, fluorine will have the highest first ionization energy. Since silicon is in the row below carbon, it has an added orbital of electrons, making it slightly easier to remove an outer electron. This extra orbital (compared to carbon) results in less of an overall force of attraction between the outer electrons and nucleus. Thus, silicon will have the lowest first ionization energy.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is an example of external locus of control?\", \"_choices\": [\"Lauren is talking on the phone and parks her car in her driveway, accidentally leaving the headlights on.

Since the assertion is that differentiation may only be occurring in vitro, the use of cells that have been cultured in vitro should be avoided, even if they are being injected back into a mouse. The reason is that the cell culture conditions could alter the cell population in some way that would not happen in vivo and would thus affect the results. For this reason, (A) can be eliminated. (B) can be eliminated because there is no indication that these tissues are only produced by the mesenchymal stem cells, just that the stem cells can differentiate into those tissues. Thus if no effect is observed when the drug is administered, it could simply be the case that other cell types take over for the lack of mesenchymal stem cells. (D) can be eliminated because many other factors contribute to aging and these confounding factors would be difficult to track against the population of mesenchymal stem cells.

It takes a while for those same schools to relax their bans. (A) is a better example of culture shock, but is also not a good description of culture lag because it is not representative of a technological change they are adopting.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl-CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). After intense exercise, one would expect PDH to be highly active to generate ATP. ADP levels (choice (A)) should be high because ATP was just burned by the muscle. Acetyl-CoA (choice (B)) is an inhibitor of PDH, causing a shift of pyruvate into the gluconeogenesis pathway.

Although the acidic group is present, it is not strongly acidic and the hydrophobic nature of the tail outweighs any enhanced solubility effect otherwise afforded by a carboxylic acid.
