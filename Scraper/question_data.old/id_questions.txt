Q: density
A: person's weight/ person's weight-apparent weight of submerged body

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Q: What is the most likely reason that the subjects were required to exhale completely prior to immersion in the water tank?
A: Air in the lungs decreases the apparent weight of the body in water and increases the percent fat estimation. 

Air is less dense than water, so air in the lungs increases the buoyant force or the weight of displaced water. From the equation derived in a previous question (ρb/ρ w = Wb/Ww), body density is inversely proportional to the weight of the displaced water. Thus, an increase in the weight of displaced water decreases the body density estimation. Considering the percent fat formula, we can conclude that a decrease in body density estimation results in an increase in percent fat estimation.

 --------------------------------------------------

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Which of the following statements are true? 

I. The blood velocity and pressure are higher in arteries than in capillaries. 

II. Blood vessels do NOT follow the Bernoulli's principle if viscosity of blood is taken into account. 

III. For an incompressible fluid undergoing laminar flow through a pipe with both narrow and wide sections, the fluid velocity is higher in the narrow areas than in wider areas. 

IV. For an incompressible fluid undergoing laminar flow through a pipe with both narrow and wide sections, the fluid pressure is higher in narrow areas than in wide areas.
A: I, II, and III only

D is correct. First, let's consider statement I. Remember, the resistance of capillaries to blood flow is much higher than that of arteries. This causes the capillaries to exhibit lower pressure than arteries. In addition, due to the larger total cross-sectional area of capillaries compared to arteries, the blood velocity in capillaries is lower than in arteries. Statement I is accurate.

Next, let's move on to statement II. Bernoulli's principle's has two underlying assumptions: incompressibility and non-viscosity of the fluid. These assumptions are not true of blood (or of any real fluid), so blood vessels don't follow Bernoulli's principle. As blood moves from arteries to capillaries, both pressure and velocity drops. This change cannot be explained by Bernoulli's equation, which is given as P + ½ρv2 + ρgh = constant.

At this point, we have our answer, since only choice D contains both I and II. However, for the sake of being thorough, let's look at statement III. The continuity equation holds that A1V1 = A2V2, where A is cross-sectional area and V is velocity. In narrowed sections, the area is smaller; therefore the velocity will be larger.

IV: Following the logic from III and using Bernoulli's principle, we can conclude that narrower sections have lower pressure than non-occluded areas.

Q: BDNF is a plasma-soluble protein secreted after being manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum. BDNF most likely:
A: has its effect through binding receptors on the external leaf of the plasma membrane. 

D is correct. A protein which is plasma-soluble is one with many hydrophilic domains. As such, it cannot easily pass through the lipophilic core of the plasma membrane and must bind to external receptors and exert its effect through second-messenger systems.
 
A: This characterizes the action of steroid hormones, which are lipophilic rather than hydrophilic.

B: Although abnormal BDNF concentrations are associated with a wide variety of neurological conditions (such as normal aging, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's), we have no reason to suppose that this protein is linked to autoimmune diseases.

C: Valine, glycine, and tryptophan are generally nonpolar and would not be found on the surface of a plasma-soluble protein.

Q: Where in the central nervous system would one be most likely to find nonmyelinating Schwann cells? 

I. C fiber nociceptors
II. White matter of the spinal cord 
III. White matter of the cerebral cortex 
IV. Efferent nerves innervating the hamstring muscles
A: A is correct. Myelinating Schwann cells myelinate large-diameter neurons, whereas nonmyelinating Schwann cells (Remak cells) form mesaxons with unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Unmyelinated neurons are typically found in the gray matter of the entire central nervous system (that is, the brain and spinal cord). They serve as interneurons that relay synaptic transduction from the sensory neurons to the motor neurons. They are also involved in pain reception (nociception).
 
II, III: White matter is a component of the central nervous system, in the brain and spinal cord, and consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that transmit signals around the CNS.

IV: Efferent neurons, also called motor neurons, are myelinated, as they mostly carry impulses to the muscles or glands and bring about movement

I. An individual distorts his opinion to match the group's opinion

II. An individual's understanding of the group's opinion is distorted to match his own opinion

III. Individual opinions and group opinions become more similar
A: D is correct. An individual changing his opinion to match the group, as stated in I, is what occurs in groupthink. Statement II is an example of confirmation bias, not groupthink. Statement III is almost the definition of groupthink
