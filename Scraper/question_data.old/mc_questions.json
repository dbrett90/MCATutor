In the ETC, the movement of electrons between carriers is used to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane; this allows ATP synthase to generate ATP for the cell. For electrons to move properly through the chain, each carrier must \\\"want\\\" to be reduced more than the one before it, or the electron transfer would not be energetically favorable. The more a carrier wants to be reduced, the higher its reduction potential. Thus, electrons move from carriers with lower reduction potential to those with higher reduction potential. \\n \\nC, D: Although some of the carriers in the ETC are responsible for pumping protons across the mitochondrial membrane, not all are. In addition, the movement of electrons is driven by reduction potential and not proton binding.

If, because of DCCD, protons are unable to return to the matrix through the ATP synthase proton pore, the proton gradient of the intermembrane space will increase, making translocation of additional protons into this space by the ETC increasingly less favorable. This will reduce the rate of electron transport through, and oxygen consumption by, the ETC. This conclusion is consistent with choice C only.\\n \\nA: Following treatment, H+ concentration within the intermembrane space is likely to increase.\\nB: ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase F1 depends on proton movement through the F0 proton pore.

This question is asking us to determine the most likely reason that ketone bodies would decrease the pH. Obviously, two of the three are acids, so the most logical explanation is simply that they are donating protons and decreasing the pH directly.

Institutional memory is the collective memory of the individuals in an organization about its history, about situations the organization has confronted, and about what was necessary to deal with them. Long-term employees are valuable as they provide institutional memory for an organization, which means that the organization does not have to figure out what to do from scratch whenever an issue similar to one in the past comes up.\\n\\nA: Cultural capital refers to non-financial assets that promote social mobility, such as education, knowledge of style or fashion, charisma, or appearance. It does not apply to organizations as a whole.\\n\\nB: Group polarization is similar in some ways to groupthink and is the tendency for a group to come to decisions even more extreme than the initial inclination of the members. Groups inclined to risk will act more riskily, while groups inclined to caution will act more cautiously. Losing a long-term employee would have only a small impact on the inclinations of the organization. \\n\\nD: Social facilitation is the tendency for people to do better on simple tasks in the presence of other people.

Choice D is therefore the correct answer.\"}, {\"_question\": \"The neurotransmitter released by the inner ear hair cells is known to excite the spiral ganglion it innervates. Based on your knowledge of neurotransmitters, which of the following is most likely the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft?\", \"_choices\": [\"GABA\", \"Acetylcholine\", \"Serotonin\", \"Glutamate\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter used in the brain, making it the most likely answer.\\n\\nA, C: GABA and serotonin are inhibitory neurotransmitters and would not be likely to excite the spiral ganglion.\\n\\nB: Acetylcholine does excite muscular cells, but it is not a common neurotransmitter in the brain or involved in sensory perception.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Researchers used a symptom list similar to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in order to diagnose psychiatric disorders and screen incompatible subjects from a study. When comparing data from previous studies, it was discovered that the symptoms on the most recent DSM differ from the symptoms on the previous list. Which of the following social theories best explains this discrepancy? \", \"_choices\": [\"Social functionalism\", \"Social interactionism\", \"Social antipositivism\", \"Social constructionism\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. The question stem presents a scenario of an evolving list of symptoms that are deemed pathological/indicative of disease. If this list is changing, that means the behaviors/symptoms society has decided are pathological are changing as well. Social constructs are how society construct the \\\"reality\\\" society will use to make judgements and evaluations such as mental health diagnoses. For example, the most recent DSM has altered gender identity disorder's classification as a mental disorder. In the realm of social constructionist thought, a social construct is any idea or notion that appears to be natural and obvious to people who accept it. This sums up the researchers' use of their list to include/exclude based on mental disease.\\n\\nA: This approach looks at society through a macro-level orientation, which is a broad focus on the social structures that shape society as a whole, and believes that society has evolved like organisms. This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements such as customs, traditions, and institutions.\\nB: In sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from human interaction. It is the study of how individuals act within society.\\nC: Antipositivism is the belief within social science that the social realm may not be subject to the same methods of investigation as the natural world; the social realm requires a different epistemology in which academics work beyond empiricism and the scientific method.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following parts of the ear are responsible for translating mechanical signals into an electrochemical signal? \", \"_choices\": [\"Hair cells in the cochlea\", \"The stapes in the middle ear\", \"Cells of the cochlear nerve\", \"Endothelial cells in the cochlear canal\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. This question is asking us to remember the function of the ear and which part of the signal transduction is responsible for conversion of mechanical energy into an electrochemical potential. The hair cells of the organ of corti in the cochlea are responsible for responding to sound waves and releasing neurotransmitters that initiate the electrical signal transduction along the cochlear nerve. Thus choice A is correct.\\n\\nB: The stapes simply converts mechanical energy into mechanical energy.\\nC: The cells of the cochlear nerve are nerve cells and thus are only propagators of the electrochemical signal, they do not initiate it.\\nD: Any endothelial cells in the cochlear canal would not be receptor cells\"}, {\"_question\": \"In what way could college increase social stratification as an agent of socialization?\", \"_choices\": [\"Students of similar social class tend to group together in college\", \"College provides opportunities for students to develop contacts that will help them professionally\", \"Students in college learn behavior appropriate for successful careers\", \"College students learn about the connection between social class and college attendance\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct.

The passage tells us that hydrophilic solubility is important, most likely because the vast majority of biological solvents are hydrophilic. In addition, an orally-administered drug must be absorbed across the membranes of the gums, stomach, or small intestine to be effective. Therefore, membrane permeability must be important because if it is low, the drug will not cross these membranes into the bloodstream.\\n \\nA, B: Though acidity or basicity (as represented by pKa and pKb) may have a small effect on bioavailability, they would not be nearly as important as hydrophilic solubility or membrane permeability.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A certain metabolic process in the liver produces NADH as a part of the process. If this process is up-regulated, which of the following effects associated with gluconeogenesis is most likely to follow?\", \"_choices\": [\"Intracellular levels of oxaloacetate will increase.\", \"Plasma glucose concentrations will increase significantly.\", \"The rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver will decrease.\", \"Plasma glucose concentrations will decrease significantly.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. The question stem tells us that NADH levels will increase. This will decrease availability of both OAA and pyruvate, two important gluconeogenic substrates. Thus, the rate of glucose production via gluconeogenesis will decrease. \\n \\nA: Because pyruvate carboxylase is inhibited by increased intracellular NADH levels, the rate of conversion of pyruvate to OAA will decrease.\\n \\nB, D: A decrease in gluconeogenesis may reduce the plasma levels of glucose somewhat, but without more information about the availability of dietary glucose or glycogen stores, neither of these choices can be concluded.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which specific class of enzymes is primarily responsible for the release of free glycerol from stored triglycerides?\", \"_choices\": [\"Lipases\", \"Carboxylases\", \"Phosphorylases\", \"Kinases\"], \"_answer\": \"lipases\"}, {\"_question\": \"The conversion between glucose and pyruvate strongly favors the formation of pyruvate, and yet the gluconeogenic pathway is able to utilize several shared enzymes with glycolysis to create glucose from pyruvate.

Which of the following is true?\", \"_choices\": [\"Student 1 and Student 3 will create circuits that have the same total capacitance.\", \"Student 2 will create the circuit with the highest capacitance.\", \"Student 2 and Student 3 will create circuits that have the same total capacitance.\", \"Student 3 will create the circuit with the highest capacitance.\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. The total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is simply the sum of their individual capacitances, so student 2 would create a circuit with 16 \\u03bcF and the highest capacitance. Student 3, by only using a single capacitor, would create a circuit with 4 \\u03bcF. When capacitors are connected in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is found by adding the reciprocals (like resistors in parallel), so student 1 would only create a circuit with 1 \\u03bcF.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following statements correctly describe the methods used in the experiment? \", \"_choices\": [\"I only\", \"I and II only\", \"II and III only\", \"I, II, and III\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. I: Retention factor is the distance migrated by the compound divided by the total distance traveled by the solvent. TLC depends on the differential affinity of a compound for the stationary vs. the mobile phase. Therefore, depending on how polar the solvent and the adsorbent are, a compound will move on a TLC plate at a certain rate. Temperature also affects the rate of movement.\\n \\nII: A polar compound will be attracted to the adsorbent (via dipole-dipole interactions) and, therefore, will move slower on a TLC plate, whereas a nonpolar compound will have more affinity for the mobile phase and will move faster.\\n \\nIII: The eluting strength depends on how strongly a compound adsorbs onto the adsorbent and, since typical adsorbents are highly polar, eluting strength increases with increasing solvent polarity. Methanol is more polar than pentane and therefore has a greater eluting strength.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Participant 1 rides a fourth roller coaster as shown below. What is the minimum ramp height H if the ride at the top of the loop maintains the minimum speed needed to stay on the track throughout the loop? (radius=8 m)\", \"_choices\": [\"10 m\", \"20 m\", \"30 m\", \"35 m\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. At the top of the loop, the gravitational and the normal forces (if any) point downward toward the center of the loop. Therefore, the net force causing centripetal acceleration is the sum of the gravitational force and the normal force.\\n\\nWhen the centripetal force is the minimum amount needed for the ride to stay on track, the normal force is zero. Note: At the top, the normal force can be zero but the gravitational force cannot. Let's designate the initial height where the ride starts as H. At the very beginning, the energy of the ride is the gravitational potential energy. Therefore, Ei = mgH.\\nAt the top of the loop, the ride includes both gravitational and potential energy. Therefore, Ef = mgH + \\u00bd mv2 = mg (2r) + \\u00bd mv 2. The net acceleration at top (centripetal acceleration) = v2/r. Since we concluded that the normal force at the top is zero, the net acceleration at the top is the gravitational acceleration, g. Therefore, v2 = gr. Substituting this equation into the 'Ef' equation, we obtain the following:\\n \\nEf = 2mgr + \\u00bd mgr = (5/2) mgr\\n \\nTo obey conservation of energy, Ei = Ef. Therefore: mgh = (5/2) mgr. We conclude that H is 5r/2. Since r is 8 m, H is 5(8 m)/2 = 20 m.\"}, {\"_question\": \"The highly toxic cyanide anion (CN-) binds strongly to cytochrome c oxidase and prevents electron transfer. Large doses of cyanide result in: \", \"_choices\": [\"I only\", \"I and II only\", \"II and III only\", \"I, II, and III\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. In questions with Roman numerals (RN), start with the RN that appears in the most answer choices. Here, I and II are in 3 questions each. If we can deduce that one of these choices is incorrect, then we will already have the correct answer. Cytochrome c oxidase is an enzyme responsible for electron transfer in the electron transport chain (ETC), so inhibiting it would slow or stop the ETC. As a result, ATP production would be dramatically reduced, as the ETC is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Thus, RN II is correct. The question stem states that cyanide is highly toxic, so it makes sense that a large dose would also cause cell death (apoptosis or necrosis). Therefore, RN III is also accurate.\\n\\nI: Inhibiting the ETC would reduce oxygen demand because electrons would no longer be flowing to oxygen, the final electron acceptor.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following best describes why hyperventilation would lead to a decreased blood CO2 concentration? \", \"_choices\": [\"The rate of CO2 production in the cells exceeds the rate of CO2 exhalation.\", \"The rate of CO2 exhalation exceeds the rate of CO2 inhalation.\", \"The rate of CO2 exhalation exceeds the rate of CO2 production in the cells.\", \"The rate of CO2 excretion in urine exceeds the rate of CO2 in the cells.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. The main source of CO2 in the human body is cellular production during the Krebs cycle. If an individual breathes very rapidly, he will exhale CO2 more quickly than his cells produce it. This leads to an unusually low concentration of carbon dioxide in the body, which correlates to a higher blood pH (alkalosis).\\n\\nA: This would explain the opposite of the situation described in the question stem.\\n\\nB: Inhalation of CO2, which has a very low concentration in air, is not a significant source of CO2 in blood.\\n\\nD: This doesn't relate to exhalation or inhalation.

When the curve is shifted to the right, the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin at high partial pressures is less affected then it is at lower pressures. We can see this by looking at Figure 1. At a PO2 of 100 mmHg, the difference in saturation between a normal and right-shifted curve is minimal. However, at a PO2 of 40 mmHg, the difference is more profound. As a result, the amount of oxygen that each red blood cell picks up in the alveoli of the lungs is not significantly decreased, but the amount of oxygen release in the tissues increases markedly.\\n\\nB: This is not a true statement; the distance between curves at 100 mmHg is less than the distance between curves at 40 mmHg.\\n\\nC: Again, this is untrue. The oxygen affinity is still slightly decreased on a right-shifted curve, even at a high PO2.\\n\\nD: This is a true statement, but it does not describe how oxygen can still be delivered more efficiently to the tissue.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A patient is administered a drug which mimics the effects of calcitonin's antagonist hormone. Which of the following is a likely direct effect of this drug?\", \"_choices\": [\"Increased buildup of hydroxyapatite crystals in long bones\", \"Decreased plasma concentrations of Ca2+\", \"Increased metabolic rate\", \"Increased osteoclast activity\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Calcitonin decreases plasma concentrations of Ca2+ by, among other things, increasing bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity and decreasing osteoclast activity. The antagonist hormone to calcitonin is parathyroid hormone, which acts to increase plasma Ca2+ concentrations by, among other things, decreasing bone formation by osteoblasts and increasing bone degradation by osteoclasts. Thus, a drug which mimics parathyroid hormone would increase osteoclast activity.\"}, {\"_question\": \"It has been shown that pheromones induce the body to secrete sex hormones more readily.

High calcium concentrations allow muscle contraction to take place. Calcium binds to troponin, which causes tropomyosin to stop blocking the binding site on the thin filaments for myosin. If the calcium channels are locked open, the muscle will not be able to stop contracting. A state of constant contraction is tetany.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Following puberty, the testes begin producing large amounts of testosterone. After production, the testosterone:\", \"_choices\": [\"is stored in secretory granules until needed to be secreted in response to declining plasma testosterone concentrations.\", \"diffuses into the circulatory system and is transported around the body while bound to a plasma protein.\", \"is sequestered in the nucleus, where it upregulates genes associated with secondary sex characteristics in males.\", \"is transported to target tissues, where it binds to cell surface receptors and triggers a second messenger cascade.\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. Remember that testosterone is a steroid hormone. As such, it can freely diffuse through cell membranes. Also, as a hormone, testosterone is transported throughout the body in the circulatory system, not confined to the nuclei of the testes. Testoserone must bind to a transport protein since it is not hydrophilic and thus cannot simply dissolve in the blood plasma directly.\\n \\nA, D: Both of these characteristics describe peptide hormones. Also, choice A is incorrect because testosterone (like any steroid hormone) could just diffuse through the membranes of vesicles.\\n \\nC: As a steroid, testosterone can't be sequestered in any membrane-bound organelle.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A researcher's agar plate becomes partially contaminated with an unknown contaminant.

Whatever's contaminated the plate is killing the bacteria, preventing them from growing into the contaminated region. A virus in the lytic phase will infect and kill bacteria.\\n \\nB: The agar itself has the necessary nutrients, since the bacteria aren't growing just where the contaminant is. Thus, adding some extra unnecessary nutrients wouldn't stop growth.\\n \\nC: In the lysogenic phase, a virus incorporates into the bacteria and allows the bacteria to grow and reproduce.\\n \\nD: Distilled water would likely just diffuse across the plate and is unlikely to be so toxic as to prevent all growth.\"}, {\"_question\": \"In the first trial of the PCR procedure, only one primer was added to the mixture.

When performing PCR, if only one primer is added to the mixture, then that primer will bind to one of the strands and initiate replication of that strand to produce the complementary strand. For one double-stranded template DNA molecule, after one cycle, we are left with two of the complementary strand while still having only one of the strands where the primer binds. In the next cycle, the primer again binds to the strand to which it is complementary. Therefore, only the complimentary strand will be replicated again; this time we have three of the complementary strand. As you can see here, one of the strands is being replicated linearly (1 \\u2192 2 \\u2192 3 \\u2192...n), while the other strand is not replicated at all. \\n \\nA: Only one of the primers is added to the mixture, so one of the strands will not have a primer to be replicated.\\n\\nB: The amplification is linear, not exponential (2n copies would be produced after n cycles) as explained above. \\n\\nD: PCR amplification will operate because one of the strands can still be replicated.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Defects in which of the following proteins would most likely lead to loss of structural integrity in skin epithelial cells?\", \"_choices\": [\"Microtubules\", \"Titin\", \"Intermediate filaments\", \"Myosin\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct.

Voluntary muscles may contract involuntarily due to a reflex arc. The classic example is the patellar tendon reflex, in which sudden stretching of the patellar tendon leads to an involuntary contraction of the quadriceps. Such contraction occurs before the signal has even reached the brain.\\n \\nA: Hyperpolarization would make it harder to generate a muscle twitch, not create more muscle contraction.\\n \\nB: If the Ca2+ ions are being appropriately modulated, the muscle would simply contract whenever it's normally supposed to - whether such contraction was voluntary or not.\\n \\nD: Dissociative disorders are not necessarily associated with involuntary spasms or tics.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Behaviorists would assert that self-defeating behaviors are maintained by immediate reinforcement in the form of:\", \"_choices\": [\"relief from anxiety.\", \"defending the ego.\", \"negating one's self-image.\", \"increasing existential anxiety.\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. People are more likely to behave in a self-defeating or destructive manner either when they perceive a threat or when they have low self-esteem. These people are more likely to be susceptible to having anxiety and emotional distress, which are problems that are usually directly related to a less favorable self-appraisal. Self-defeating or self-destructive behaviors often manifest due to an inability to handle either anxiety or stress which results from a lack of self-confidence. Thus engaging in these behaviors offers an immediate relief from anxiety which then reinforces that behavior.\\n \\nB, C, D: None of these choices reinforce self-defeating behaviors.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A psychosis arising from an advanced stage of syphilis, in which the disease attacks brain cells, is called:\", \"_choices\": [\"Korsakoff's syndrome.\", \"delirium tremens.\", \"schizotypal personality disorder.\", \"general paresis\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct.

During which stage of sleep is bedwetting most likely to occur? \", \"_choices\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"REM\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. Typically, sleepers pass through five stages: 1, 2, 3, 4, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM, then begin again with stage 1. When a person enters stage 3 sleep, extremely slow brain waves called delta waves are interspersed with smaller, faster waves. In stage 4, the brain produces delta waves almost exclusively. During stages 3 and 4, it is very difficult to wake someone. Also, during this \\\"deep sleep,\\\" there is no eye movement or muscle activity. This is when some children experience bedwetting, sleepwalking, or night terrors.\\n\\nA: Stage 1 represents light sleep, where one drifts in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. In this stage, the eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows.\\n\\nB: In stage 2 sleep, eye movement stops and brain waves become slower, with only an occasional burst of rapid brain waves called sleep spindles.\\n\\nD: During REM sleep, breathing becomes more rapid, irregular and shallow; eyes jerk rapidly, and limb muscles are temporarily paralyzed.

Phosphoric acid is H3PO4, and all three of its hydrogen atoms are acidic. As a result, there are three associated anions (PO43-, HPO42-, and H2PO4-), which are typically named phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and dihydrogen phosphate, respectively. Alternatively, we can refer to these anions in terms of their ability to act as Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry bases. For example, PO43- has the ability to gain three protons, so it can be called tribasic phosphate. Calcium ion is Ca2+, and when combined with the dibasic anion, HPO42-, the resulting formula is that in choice C. \\n\\nA: Since calcium ion has a +2 charge while phosphate carries a -3 charge, this formula does not make sense. \\n\\nB: PO43- is the tribasic, not the dibasic, ion. \\n\\nD: The anion in this choice is the monobasic ion.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following potential ingredients in a multivitamin and mineral supplement would be least soluble in aqueous solution? \", \"_choices\": [\"Potassium chloride\", \"Ferrous sulfate\", \"Sodium selenate\", \"Aluminium oxide\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Like the vast majority of ionic compounds with Group 1 cations, potassium chloride and sodium selenate are soluble in aqueous solution. This eliminates choices A and C. Most ionic sulfate compounds are soluble, with a couple of exceptions, including PbSO4, CaSO4, BaSO4 and SrSO4. Since ferrous sulfate is not one of these exceptions, it is soluble in aqueous solution and choice B can be eliminated. Most oxides are insoluble, except when the cation is a group 1 ion. Aluminum oxide is very insoluble in aqueous solution.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A scientist uses an ultrasound device to measure fluid flow underground.

Competitive inhibitors are those which \\\"compete\\\" with the substrate for binding at the active site. Since both inhibitor and substrate attach at the same position, the addition of sufficient quantities of substrate can overcome the inhibitor and allow the reaction to reach its original maximum rate. For this reason, the maximal rate of the reaction (Vmax) does not change.\\n\\nHowever, competitive inhibitors do change the Km, or the concentration of substrate required to reach one-half of Vmax.

The obstruction would also fail to explain the fever, a typical sign of infection by a foreign pathogen. \\nB: Leukemia could cause swollen lymph nodes and can present with a fever, but is less likely to do so than infection.\\nD: Breast cancer is common in adults, but is unheard of in children. This is because breast tissue doesn't develop until puberty under the influence of hormones, and it takes many years for a premalignant lesion to pick up the mutations necessary for it to become cancer.\"}, {\"_question\": \"At excess levels, which of the following could serve as an activator of the TCA enzyme citrate synthase? \", \"_choices\": [\"ADP\", \"Citrate\", \"Succinyl-CoA\", \"NADH\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. TCA is another name for the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle. Increased concentration of ADP signals that more ATP is needed. Therefore, the citric acid cycle enzyme will be activated by the presence of ADP. \\n \\nB: Citrate is the product of the enzyme citrate synthase. Through negative feedback, citrate accumulation would inhibit further citrate production. \\nC: Succinyl-CoA is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Excess accumulation of cycle intermediates would serve as a signal that enough citric acid cycles have been run. Excess succinyl-CoA would most likely inhibit the cycle. \\nD: NADH is a product of the citric acid cycle. Therefore, its production would act to inhibit the cycle.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Fluid pressure changes with depth are assumed to be linear. Which statement best explains why this does not hold true for atmospheric pressure changes? \", \"_choices\": [\"At very high temperatures, air behaves less ideally.\", \"The volume of a mass of air is not constant.\", \"The majority of molecules in air are nonpolar.\", \"Air is not of a uniform composition.\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. Hydrostatic pressure for liquids is linear because as depth changes, the density of the liquid remains constant. Gases, however, have densities that change according to the forces applied to them. Gases are compressible, while liquids and solids are not.\\n\\nA: For gases, higher temperatures result in behavior that is more ideal. \\n\\nC: This is true, but does not explain the non-linear behavior.\\n\\nD: The kinetic molecular theory of gases states that gaseous mixtures do not act differently from pure gases, nor would this explain non-linear behavior.\"}, {\"_question\": \"In the electron transport chain, which of the following is the component that is reduced but never oxidized?\", \"_choices\": [\"Ubiquinone\", \"Oxygen\", \"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\", \"ADP\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. This question is testing your knowledge of the electron transport chain. Almost all elements in the chain are at some point reduced and oxidized. This is the driving force behind the electron transport chain. However, at the end of the chain, oxygen is reduced to form H2O, which is the end fate of the electrons in the chain.\\n\\nA: Ubiquinone accepts electrons, then passes them off. Therefore, it is both reduced and oxidized.\\n\\nC: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide refers to NAD+/NADH. This compound is reduced to form NADH and oxidized back to NAD+ after transferring an electron to Complex I of the electron transport chain.\\n\\nD: ADP is oxidized to ATP.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Cefixime displays what inhibitive behavior on PBP? \", \"_choices\": [\"Competitive inhibition\", \"Non-competitive inhibition\", \"Uncompetitive inhibition\", \"Suicide inhibition\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. According to the passage, cephalosporins bind irreversibly to the active site of PBP. Of the inhibitor types given as answer choices, only a suicide inhibitor acts as an irreversible enzyme inhibitor. Suicide inhibition occurs when an enzyme binds the inhibitor (structurally a substrate analogue) and forms an irreversible complex with it, usually through a covalent bond. This can involve the inhibitor being chemically modified by the enzyme during the normal course of catalysis to produce a reactive group that is specifically responsible for the formation of the irreversible inhibitor-enzyme complex.\\n\\nA, B, C: Each of these inhibitor types works through a reversible inhibition mechanism.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Air is bubbled through distilled water. The solution will have a pH:\", \"_choices\": [\"greater than 7 because elemental nitrogen undergoes hydrolysis.\", \"less than 7 because elemental nitrogen undergoes hydrolysis.\", \"greater than 7 because carbon dioxide undergoes hydrolysis.\", \"less than 7 because carbon dioxide undergoes hydrolysis.\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Air contains elemental nitrogen as its major component, but elemental nitrogen is essentially inert and is neither an acid nor a base. On the other hand, carbon dioxide can undergo a hydrolysis reaction in liquid water to produce carbonic acid, a weak acid that produces a solution whose pH is less than the pH of water (pH = 7).\"}, {\"_question\": \"What is the approximate pH of a saturated aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid whose molarity is 10.6 M?\", \"_choices\": [\"-1\", \"1\", \"7\", \"13\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and completely dissociates in aqueous solution. In this solution, the hydronium ion concentration is 10.6 M, which can be approximated as 10 M to make the math easier. The pH is the -log of the hydronium ion concentration: -log[10] = -log[101] = -1. While the typical pH range is normally thought of as ranging from 0 to 14, if the concentration of hydronium ion is greater than 1 M, negative pH values are possible. It is also possible to have pH values greater than 14, i.e. if the hydroxide concentration is greater than 1 M.\"}, {\"_question\": \"When a patient is on the operating table for heart surgery, surgeons need to clamp major nearby blood vessels before cutting them because, according to Bernoulli's equation, a volume of pressurized blood opened to the atmosphere: \", \"_choices\": [\"will convert its pressure to kinetic energy, rapidly exiting the body and causing shock.\", \"will convert its pressure to potential energy, pooling at the high places of the body and causing a potential brain aneurysm or stroke.\", \"will match outside pressure by decreasing fluid speed, starving the body of oxygen.\", \"is at risk of over-oxidizing, dangerously increasing pressure.\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. When the surgeons cut into the artery, blood will obviously shoot out of the body as a result of blood pressure. That pressure is converted to kinetic energy, causing the blood to move rapidly as it exits the body.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A man is accidentally exposed to a toxin which binds irreversibly and noncompetitively to pyruvate dehydrogenase. A likely consequence of this ingestion is:\", \"_choices\": [\"a decrease in lactic acid concentration in exposed cells.\", \"an increase in the concentration of acetyl-CoA in exposed cells.\", \"a decrease in the level of Krebs cycle activity within the exposed cells.\", \"an increased rate of formation of NADH in exposed cells.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the enzyme that mediates pyruvate decarboxylation. This step is the critical link between anaerobic and aerobic respiration. With this link broken, cells would be limited to anaerobic respiration. Thus, a decrease in aerobic respiration makes sense in this context.\\n\\nA: Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic respiration. With pyruvate decarboxylation blocked, the cell would likely see an increase in such products.\\n\\nB, D: Acetyl-CoA and NADH are products of pyruvate decarboxylation. Blocking this enzyme would lower these concentrations.\"}, {\"_question\": \"If a lung is punctured, what effect will this likely have on breathing? \", \"_choices\": [\"The lung will fill in with blood from the surrounding intrapleural pace, leaving less room for oxygen.\", \"The punctured lung will be unable to inflate, affecting inhalation.\", \"Breathing will be painful, but otherwise unaffected.\", \"All air will rush out of the lung and inhalation will be impossible.\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. During typical breathing, the diaphragm contracts, flattening it and increasing the volume of the intrapleural space. As a result, the lungs expand and the pressure inside them decreases. The resulting pressure differential between the lungs and the atmosphere causes air to rush in, a process termed inspiration. If the lungs are punctured, air will flow freely between the lung and the intrapleural space, and the lung will not expand (since no pressure differential can be maintained). Expansion of the thoracic cavity should still lead to some air flow into the lung, however, although it will also mix freely with the thoracic cavity's air, making it more difficult to absorb oxygen within the damaged lung while also making it harder to maintain a pressure differential with the other lung. Thus, B is definitely true.\\n\\nA: The surrounding intrapleural space includes a small amount of fluid, but the lungs are not submerged in blood.\\n\\nC: Breathing will certainly be adversely affected in cases of a puncture.\\n\\nD: This is an extreme answer (\\\"all\\\" air). Additionally, air would not rush out of the lung unless the lung were under higher pressure than the surroundings, which is likely untrue.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is NOT a part of the respiratory system? \", \"_choices\": [\"The epiglottis\", \"The lacteals\", \"The larynx\", \"The right bronchus\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. This is a straightforward anatomy question with no information from the passage needed. The lacteals are structures in the intestines associated with absorbing fat into the lymphatic system.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is an accurate statement regarding mitosis and meiosis?\", \"_choices\": [\"Mitosis results in two haploid daughter cells.\", \"During mitosis and meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated.\", \"During meiosis I and meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated.\", \"Meiosis I results in two diploid daughter cells.\"], \"_answer\": \"B\"}, {\"_question\": \"The disruption of which membrane component is most likely to result in cellular traffic complications similar to those seen in gap junction disorders? \", \"_choices\": [\"Cholesterol\", \"Glycoproteins\", \"Glycolipids\", \"Phospholipids\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. The cell membrane is composed of several different components, each responsible for different functions. Membrane transport is most likely to be affected if the disruption occurs in components that span the entire membrane. Transmembrane proteins (many of which are glycoproteins) are the only component listed that pass all the way through the cell membrane and facilitate membrane transport.\\n\\nA: Cholesterol does not facilitate membrane traffic, nor does it extend across the entire membrane.\\n\\nC, D: Phospholipids and glycolipids are located on the surface of cell membranes and typically do not extend though the entire bilayer. Glycolipids act to provide energy and also serve as markers for cellular recognition. Phospholipids are a structural component of the membrane and are not involved in traffic/transport.\"}, {\"_question\": \"What type of control does siRNA exert on G6P expression? \", \"_choices\": [\"Transcriptional control\", \"Promotion\", \"Repression\", \"Post-transcriptional control\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Due to its structure, siRNA is only able to bind to other RNA strands, not to DNA or protein. Therefore, it must interfere with gene expression after transcription has already occurred, but before translation. Specifically, it prevents the translation of mRNA corresponding to the target protein.\\n\\nA, B, C: These controls occur before transcription. In contrast, siRNA prevents mRNA from being translated.\"}, {\"_question\": \"In severe diabetic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), insulin cannot effectively induce the uptake of glucose by cells. Hyperglycemia directly leads to the presence of which of these molecules in the urine? \", \"_choices\": [\"I only\", \"I and II only\", \"II and III only\", \"I, II, and III\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. This question requires outside knowledge about glucose metabolism. If cells cannot take up glucose, it will remain in the blood and eventually be excreted in the urine when it builds up to the point that it cannot be reabsorbed by the nephron. In a state of hyperglycemia, the body relies on fat metabolism to generate energy, which produces ketone bodies that are also excreted in the urine. Therefore, Roman numerals II and III are correct.\\n\\nI: Proteins in the urine are not the result of hyperglycemia, but rather damage to the glomerulus.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Meiosis I results in: \", \"_choices\": [\"2 diploid cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 2 sister chromatids.\", \"2 haploid cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 1 chromatid.\", \"2 haploid cells with 23 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 2 sister chromatids.\", \"2 diploid cells with 23 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 1 chromatid.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. Meiosis I results in 2 haploid cells, each with 23 chromosomes consisting of 2 sister chromatids per chromosome. In the male, the sister chromatids are split into 4 gametes during meiosis II. For females, meiosis I results in a secondary oocyte (a gamete) and a polar body. Penetration of the secondary oocyte by a sperm brings on anaphase II. Telophase II produces a zygote and a second polar body. Remember for the MCAT: mitosis results in diploid daughter cells, while meiosis results in haploid cells to produce gametes.\\n \\nA: Neither meiosis nor mitosis results in 46 chromosomes with 2 sister chromatids. In mitosis, the sister chromatids separate to create daughter cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of a single chromatid.\\n\\nB: Haploid cells have 23 chromosomes.\\n\\nD: Diploid cells have 46 chromosomes.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Uracil is usually found in: \", \"_choices\": [\"I only\", \"II only\", \"I and II only\", \"I, II, and III\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct.

A kinship of affinity is one in which individuals are related by choice, such as through marriage, rather than through blood, such as the other choices.\\n \\nA, B, D: All of these choices describe blood relations.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following was NOT a finding by Harry Harlow in his experiments with rhesus monkeys and their pairing with a simulated mother made from wire (Wire Mother) or one made from soft cloth (Cloth Mother)?\", \"_choices\": [\"Monkeys paired with Wire Mothers drank similar amounts of milk and grew at a rate comprable to monkeys paired with Cloth Mothers.\", \"Monkeys paired with a Wire Mother sought soothing from their \\\"mothers,\\\" but at a rate less than monkeys paired with Cloth Mothers.\", \"After early neglectful conditions, monkeys' abnormal behavior could be corrected by pairing them with the appropriate simulated mother.\", \"When given a choice, monkeys spent more time holding Cloth Mothers than Wire Mothers.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. In Harlow's experiment, the infant monkeys preferred spending their time clinging to the cloth mother. Even when only the wire mother could provide food, the monkeys visited her just to eat. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the mother/infant relationship than milk and that this \\\"contact comfort\\\" was crucial to the psychological development and health of infants. After monkeys were paired with a Wire Mother, they showed abnormal behavior, which could not be corrected later in life by pairing them with a Cloth Mother.\\n \\nA: This is true. Monkeys with both Cloth and Wire Mothers drank similar amounts and grew similar amounts.\\n\\nB: This is true. In fact, monkeys paired with Wire Mothers very rarely sought soothing from their \\\"mothers\\\" at all and went almost only to eat.\\n\\nD: This is true.

The cerebellum is responsible for muscle memory and coordination. When playing the song for the thousandth time, it will be played mostly from muscle memory.\\n\\nA: Frontal lobe is primarily involved in reward, planning, motivation, and inhibitions. It also houses the motor cortex, which controls movement, but that is likely to be equally activated regardless of how well-known the piece of music is.\\n\\nB: The temporal lobe is involved in memory, but this sort of muscle memory is more likely to be cerebellar in nature.\\n\\nD: The parietal lobe is involved primarily in regulating and interpreting sensory data and would not be more active while playing a well-known piece.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A public health advocacy group has developed a program to encourage adherence to a Truvada medication regimen using operant conditioning principles.

In operant conditioning, thinning refers to reducing the frequency of rewards for a given action.\\n\\nA: This is not an example of thinning in operant conditioning.\\n\\nB: This is known as fading in operant conditioning.\\n\\nD: This is close to a sensible answer, but the reinforcement schedule would need to be changed from continuous to variable.\"}, {\"_question\": \"In respect to peer relationships and self-esteem, late physical maturation in pubescents has been found to have which of the following effects? \", \"_choices\": [\"Positive effects for females and positive effects for males\", \"Positive effects for females and negative effects for males\", \"Negative effects for females and positive effects for males\", \"Negative effects for females and negative effects for males\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. Females tend to benefit from maturing later, due in part to feeling less self-conscious about body image. In contrast, males tend to feel more self-conscious if they develop later.\"}, {\"_question\": \"How could researchers design a study to specifically determine whether there is institutional, but not individual, discrimination at a particular organization?\", \"_choices\": [\"Compare the demographics of individuals hired at the organization with the demographics at similar organizations\", \"Compare the demographics of individuals hired by several hiring directors within the organization\", \"Neither A nor B\", \"Both A and B together\"], \"_answer\": \"D is correct. Both A and B are required here. Method A could show that there is a difference between organizations with regard to hiring practices, which implies institutional discrimination.

Assimilation is a strategy in which the individual seeks to interact with the new culture and reject the native culture.\\n \\nB: Separation is rejecting the new culture and maintaining the native culture.\\n\\nC: Marginalization involves the rejection of both cultures.\\n\\nD: Integration involves identifying with both cultures.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A shopper behaves very aggressively towards another shopper and, in response, the store manager refuses to sell a coveted toy to the shopper. This experience would most likely serve as: \", \"_choices\": [\"positive punishment.\", \"negative reinforcement.\", \"negative punishment.\", \"positive reinforcement.\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. Here, something is being taken away from the shopper - the opportunity to purchase a particular item - which makes this a negative reaction. Remember that positive responses in operant condition involve adding something (giving a food pellet, giving a shock) but negative ones involve removing somethings (removing a noxious noise, removing food). Since the action is something the shopper would not want, it is more likely that the aggressive behavior would decrease rather than increase, making it a punishment.\"}, {\"_question\": \"What group phenomenon was most likely responsible for the aggressive behavior seen at Store 2?\", \"_choices\": [\"Social loafing\", \"Deindividuation\", \"Social facilitation\", \"Social control\"], \"_answer\": \"B is correct. Based on the data in Tables 1 and 2, we can see that there are a large number of violent incidents happening, along with a wide range of violent behavior. Deindividuation refers to a situation where a person doesn't feel like they are accountable for their actions based on the actions of others in the group. They temporarily \\\"lose\\\" their identity, meaning things they usually value about themselves (like being polite or patient while shopping) don't impact their behavior as much as what they observe around them.\\n \\nA: Social loafing refers to a situation where an individual does not pull his/her weight in a group setting.\\n\\nC: Social facilitation refers to improved performance while in the presence of a group.\\n\\nD: Social control refers to enforcement of conformity.

Which theory best describes how she learned this behavior? \", \"_choices\": [\"Social cognitive theory\", \"Classical conditioning theory\", \"Operant conditioning theory\", \"Cognitive dissonance theory\"], \"_answer\": \"A is correct. Social cognitive theory asserts that people learn by watching others, and if they see someone is rewarded for a behavior, they are more likely to behave that way too.\\n\\nB: Classical conditioning involves pairing two stimuli to produce a specific response.\\n\\nC: Operant conditioning uses reinforcement or punishment to increase or decrease likelihood of an individual's behavior. In this case, the first rude shopper was reinforced for acting like a jerk, so he is more likely to behave that way in the future, but the second shopper hasn't had any consequences to increase or decrease her rude behavior.\\n\\nD: Dissonance theory refers to a conflict between beliefs and actions that leads to changes in behavior.\"}, {\"_question\": \"The media portrayal of shoppers who are violent and aggressive or who misbehave on Black Friday in order to shame or ridicule them is an example of what type of social control?\", \"_choices\": [\"Formal positive sanction\", \"Formal negative sanction\", \"Informal negative sanction\", \"Informal positive sanction\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct. An informal sanction is an action by a peer or group of peers that is meant to make behavior more normative. It usually involves shaming or ridicule, which is considered a punishment. When the media shames people who engage in non-normative behavior (acting like a jerk while shopping), they are trying to enforce norms in an informal way.\\n \\nA: A formal positive sanction is an official reward for an action or behavior. For example, individuals who help others in a crisis are often given a reward or a medal for doing so.\\n\\nB: A formal negative sanction is an official punishment for an action or behavior; for example, a customer who was violent with others may be banned from a store for life - this is a consequence enforced by a group or organization, the business or store.\\n\\nD: The media did not reward the behavior exhibited, so this is not a positive sanction.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following steps could an organization take to make itself into a more ideal bureaucracy?\", \"_choices\": [\"Making distinctions between management and employees less pronounced\", \"Cross-training employees to be proficient in different skills\", \"Evaluating how decisions impact stock price in an \\\"up-focused\\\" organization\", \"Promoting individuals until they reach a level above their skill set\"], \"_answer\": \"C is correct.

Of the three listed, fluorine is the closest element to the upper-right in the Periodic Table. The first ionization energy measures the difficulty in removing a valence electron. Because of fluorine's position and inherent electronegativity, it is very difficult to remove one of its valence electrons. Thus, fluorine will have the highest first ionization energy. Since silicon is in the row below carbon, it has an added orbital of electrons, making it slightly easier to remove an outer electron. This extra orbital (compared to carbon) results in less of an overall force of attraction between the outer electrons and nucleus. Thus, silicon will have the lowest first ionization energy.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is an example of external locus of control?\", \"_choices\": [\"\", \"Gretchen is no longer kept awake by her roommate's late night keyboard typing.\", \"Lauren is talking on the phone and parks her car in her driveway, accidentally leaving the headlights on.

The reason is that the cell culture conditions could alter the cell population in some way that would not happen in vivo and would thus affect the results. For this reason, (A) can be eliminated. (B) can be eliminated because there is no indication that these tissues are only produced by the mesenchymal stem cells, just that the stem cells can differentiate into those tissues. Thus if no effect is observed when the drug is administered, it could simply be the case that other cell types take over for the lack of mesenchymal stem cells. (D) can be eliminated because many other factors contribute to aging and these confounding factors would be difficult to track against the population of mesenchymal stem cells. (C) is the correct answers because it is the closes approximation to in vivo conditions with minimal manipulation of the cell conditions while still allowing direct observation of their activities in the body.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following scenarios best fits culture lag? \", \"_choices\": [\"A family immigrates from a country with frequent water shortages and maintains the policy of keeping the bathtub full of water at all times.\", \"High schools relax bans on cell phone usage several years after their use among teenagers becomes commonplace.\", \"A culture with no history of exposure to technology is suddenly provided with electronics which it subsequently fails to adopt.\", \"A group of children learns how to play a new game from children in another neighborhood. The game slowly spreads across the general population.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: B\\n\\nCulture lag is the catch-up or lag that a culture experiences during the adoption of new technologies. Often culture lag results in tensions from forces that resist the change. The best example of this is (B), as schools' failure to recognize the changes in the ways students use technology led to bans of the technology's use. It takes a while for those same schools to relax their bans. (A) is a better example of culture shock, but is also not a good description of culture lag because it is not representative of a technological change they are adopting. (C) is incorrect because culture lag is about how the culture responds as technology is adopted and cannot happen if the technology is not adopted. (D) is incorrect as it is not relevant to culture lag.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Excitatory estrogen receptors have been recently found on osteoblasts. During menopause, there is a sharp decrease in the amount of estrogen production. Which of the following can be expected?\", \"_choices\": [\"A decrease in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may lead to osteoporosis\", \"An increase in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may lead to osteoporosis\", \"A decrease in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may prevent osteoporosis\", \"An increase in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may prevent osteoporosis\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: B\\n\\nIn menopause, there is a decrease in the concentration of estrogen. Hence, there will be decreased stimulation of the osteoblasts. Since osteoblasts and osteoclasts are in constant opposition, decreased stimulation of the osteoblasts will result in an increased ratio of osteoclast to osteoblast activity. This will lead to decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption, which may lead to osteoporosis. The correct answer is (B).\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following is true with regard to a major depressive episode?\", \"_choices\": [\"It may last less than two weeks.\", \"It must involve thoughts of suicide or a suicide attempt.\", \"It may involve a decrease in sleep.\", \"It must involve feelings of sadness.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: C\\n\\nDepression is marked by a period of at least two weeks in which the patient has five of nine cardinal symptoms, one of which must be depressed mood or lack of interest (anhedonia). While decreased need for sleep is commonly seen in manic episodes, it may also appear in depression as sleep disturbance is one of the nine cardinal symptoms. Not all depressed individuals are suicidal, as in choice (B). In older men, depression may often manifest as anhedonia without feelings of sadness, invalidating choice (D).\"}, {\"_question\": \"After a brief period of intense exercise, the activity of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. This increased activity is most likely due to:\", \"_choices\": [\"decreased ADP.\", \"increased acetyl-CoA.\", \"increased NADH/NAD+ ratio.\", \"increased pyruvate concentration.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: D\\n\\nIn most biochemical pathways, only a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl-CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). After intense exercise, one would expect PDH to be highly active to generate ATP. ADP levels (choice (A)) should be high because ATP was just burned by the muscle. Acetyl-CoA (choice (B)) is an inhibitor of PDH, causing a shift of pyruvate into the gluconeogenesis pathway. A high NADH/NAD+ ratio (choice (C)) would imply that the cell is already energetically satisfied and not in need of energy, which would not be expected in intensely exercising muscle.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Conductive deafness is often caused by accumulated fluid in the middle ear inhibiting the passage of sounds to the cochlea and auditory nerve. Sensori-neural deafness is caused by damage to, or malformation of, the inner ear or auditory nerve. Which of the following are true concerning sound waves?\", \"_choices\": [\"I only\", \"I and III only\", \"II and III only\", \"None of the above\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: D\\n\\n\\nI. Sound waves are mechanical disturbances that are propagated through deformable material mediums.\\n\\nII. Sound waves travel faster through solids than liquids. Sound waves travel faster through liquids than gases.\\n\\nIII. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.\"}, {\"_question\": \"At what stage does dormancy occur in primary oocytes?\", \"_choices\": [\"Metaphase I\", \"Prophase II\", \"Metaphase II\", \"Prophase I\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: D\\nPrimary oocytes begin the first meiotic division before birth but enter a prolonged period of dormancy during prophase I, choice (D). This dormancy lasts until puberty. Shortly before ovulation, the primary oocyte completes the first meiotic division due to an LH surge, giving rise to a secondary oocyte and a polar body. Upon ovulation, the secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division and pauses at metaphase II. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because secondary oocytes, not primary oocytes, undergo prophase II and metaphase II. Choice (A) is incorrect because the primary oocyte does not enter metaphase I until shortly before ovulation.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following trends regarding healthcare disparities has NOT been documented?\", \"_choices\": [\"Females are more likely to be insured than males.\", \"Primary care use is more likely among males than females.\", \"Low-income individuals have more difficulty accessing care than high-income individuals.\", \"LGBT individuals have more barriers to healthcare than heterosexuals.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: B\\n\\nIn comparison to females, males visit primary care doctors less frequently.

Her parents describe that any time she is startled, she appears to collapse and fall asleep. She also complains of waking up in the morning unable to move. Which sleep disorder should be suspected?\", \"_choices\": [\"Insomnia\", \"Sleep deprivation\", \"Narcolepsy\", \"Sleep apnea\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: C\\n\\nThe patient and her parents are describing cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone and intrusion of REM sleep during waking hours, usually in response to a startling or emotional trigger) and sleep paralysis (an inability to move despite being awake, usually when waking up in the morning). These symptoms are highly suggestive of narcolepsy; in fact, some consider cataplexy to be pathognomonic for (absolutely indicative of) the disorder.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the following best explains why glutamic acid is less soluble than glycine in water at a neutral pH? \", \"_choices\": [\"Glutamic acid is more acidic.\", \"Glutamic acid does not dissociate in water.\", \"Glutamic acid is larger and more hydrophobic than glycine.\", \"Glutamic acid has more nitrogen atoms.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: C\\n\\nGlutamic acid is only slightly soluble in water in large part due to its hydrophobic tail acidic group at the end. Although the acidic group is present, it is not strongly acidic and the hydrophobic nature of the tail outweighs any enhanced solubility effect otherwise afforded by a carboxylic acid. Thus the correct answer is (C). (B) is incorrect because some dissociation does occur. (D) is incorrect because it is untrue and the presence of nitrogen atoms does not directly impact solubility.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency can be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Patients with this disease have difficulty walking because they lose the ability to feel where their feet are in space. This represents a loss of:\", \"_choices\": [\"vestibular sense.\", \"kinesthetic sense.\", \"parallel processing.\", \"feature detection.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: B\\n\\nKinesthetic sense, or proprioception, refers to the ability to tell where body parts are in three-dimensional space. The sensors for proprioception are found predominantly in the muscles and joints. Loss of vestibular sense, choice (A), would also cause difficulty walking, but this would be due to a sense of dizziness or vertigo, not an inability to feel one's feet.\"}, {\"_question\": \"A particular template DNA strand (noncoding strand) is composed of 18% cytosine and 20% guanine. What percentage of its RNA transcript will contain cytosine assuming no introns are removed? \", \"_choices\": [\"18%\", \"20%\", \"36%\", \"38%\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: B\\n\\nSince cytosine is present in both DNA and RNA, it should be present in the RNA transcript. From the template strand, all G nucleotides would be transcribed into C. Thus the way to determine the amount of C in the RNA transcript is to look at the amount of G that is in the template strand which was 20%. Thus (B) is the correct answer.\"}, {\"_question\": \"Exposure to endotoxin triggers a rapid immune response without requiring past exposure. The immune response is most likely mediated by:\", \"_choices\": [\"the innate immune system.\", \"B cells.\", \"T cells.\", \"the adaptive immune system.\"], \"_answer\": \"Answer: A\\n\\nB cells and T cells are both part of the adaptive immune system, both of which involve more complex responses and are generally slower in responding to novel antigens. The innate immune system is a rapid response mechanism and mediates respones without requiring previous exposure to an antigen\"}, {\"_question\": \"A Cuban-American man living in the United States has the dominant physical features of a black man.
