The blind spot is the area where the optic nerve connects to the retina. The 'night blind spot' occurs under conditions of low light and can extend 5 to 10 degrees from the center of the person's field of view. What is the cause of the 'night blind spot'?
['Mesopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due '
 'to the lack of rods.',
 'Photopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of cones.']

The tympanic reflex helps prevent damage from loud sounds. How does the tensor tympani work to protect one's hearing?
['The tensor tympani loosens the tympanic membrane. This allows the vibrations '
 'to pass more easily through the ear.',
 'The tensor tympani produces sounds by vibrating. This allows the ear to '
 'adapt to loud sounds.',
 'The tensor tympani tightens the tympanic membrane. This changes the '
 'frequency of the sound to a frequency outside the range of hearing.',
 'The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. '
 'This slows down transduction.']
It is not possible to adapt to loud sound. Over time intense vibration from loud sounds causes damage to hair cells and loss of hearing.

Strong vibrations in the ear could damage the hair cells, regardless of whether they are within the audible range.

The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. This slows down transduction.

According to Maslow's hierarchy, what are these workers currently motivated by?
['Safety needs',
 'Physiological needs',
 'Belonging needs',
 'Actualization needs']
The worker's ability to produce food is dependent on their sense of stability in the workplace.

Physiological needs are basic needs, like food, shelter, or water.

Belonging needs are needs related to acceptance and friendship.

Actualization needs are related to personal fulfillment and achievement.

Safety needs are associated with stability, security, protection, and freedom from threats. The workers are currently motivated to pursue safety needs.

A manic episode is a period of abnormally elevated mood and abnormally increased energy lasting at least 7 consecutive days, the episode is severe enough to cause impairment in functioning or to require hospitalization

Although it is possible for an individual diagnosed with bipolar I to never experience hypomania, it is extremely unlikely.

An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never experienced a manic episode.

An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never had a manic episode. An individual diagnosed with bipolar I disorder has had at least one manic episode.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Unlike the DSM-IV-TR, the DSM-5 makes a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders by stating that "a paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder". What does this difference in approach toward the description of paraphilic disorders imply?
['The APA is making a distinction between normative and nonnormative behavior, '
 'labeling nonnormative behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather '
 'emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, '
 'before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA has changed the description for paraphilia to allow it to cover more '
 'forms of nonnormative behavior. Labeling these behaviors as '
 'psychopathological allows more people with paraphilic disorder to obtain '
 'help.',
 'The APA believes that individuals engaging in nonnormative sexual practices '
 'have paraphilic disorders.']
The DSM-5 describes paraphilia as any intense and persistent sexual interest other than genital stimulation or fondling in phenotypically normal, physically mature, and consenting human partners. Paraphilias include sexual sadism (inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering), masochism (being humiliated, bound, or suffering), transvestic (sexually arousing cross-dressing, in addition to voyeurism (spying on others) and frotteurism (touching or rubbing genitals against a nonconsenting individual), and pedophilia (sexual focus towards children).

The APA did not change which behaviors are labeled as normative or nonnormative paraphilias, but instead focused on whether the paraphilia causes distress or impairment to the individual or others before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.

The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.

After a brief period of intense exercise, the activity of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. This increased activity is most likely due to:
['decreased ADP',
 'increased acetyl-CoA',
 'increased NADH/NAD+ ratio',
 'increased pyruvate concentration']
D.) increased pyruvate concentration

In most biochemical pathways, only a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl-CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). After intense exercise, one would expect PDH to be highly active to generate ATP. ADP levels (choice (A)) should be high because ATP was just burned by the muscle. Acetyl-CoA (choice (B)) is an inhibitor of PDH, causing a shift of pyruvate into the gluconeogenesis pathway. A high NADH/NAD+ ratio (choice (C)) would imply that the cell is already energetically satisfied and not in need of energy, which would not be expected in intensely exercising muscle.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a method by which enzymes decrease the activation energy for biological reactions?
['Modifying the local charge environment',
 'Forming transient covalent bonds',
 'Acting as electron donors or acceptors',
 'Breaking bonds in the enzyme to provide energy']
D.) Breaking bonds in the enzyme to provide energy

Enzymes are not altered by the process of catalysis. A molecule that breaks intramolecular bonds to provide activation energy would not be able to be reused.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Elephant seal males mate with multiple females each mating season, while females only have one mate each. What type of mating system is this?
['Polyandry', 'Polygyny', 'Monogamy', 'Promiscuity']
B.) Polygyny

Polygamy involves a male having exclusive relationships with several females (polygyny) or a female having exclusive relationships with several males (polyandry), choice (A). Monogamy, choice (C), consists of exclusive mating relationships. Promiscuity, choice (D), refers to a member of one sex mating with any member of the opposite sex.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following INCORRECTLY pairs a digestive hormone with its function?
['Trypsin -- hydrolyzes specific peptide bond',
 'Lactase -- hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose',
 'Pancreatic amylase -- hydrolyzes starch to maltose',
 'Lipase -- emulsifies fats']
D.) Lipase -- emulsifies fats

Lipase is involved in the digestion of fats, but its function is not to emulsify fats—this is the job of bile. Rather, lipase chemically digests fats in the duodenum, allowing them to be brought into duodenal cells and packaged into chylomicrons. The other associations given here are all correct.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An EMT sees himself as a bit of a rebel, but is highly sociable and is able to keep calm in an emergency. This person would likely score in the lower range of which of the following traits?
['Psychoticism', 'Neuroticism', 'Extraversion', 'Conscientiousness']
B.) Neuroticism

As a rebel and a sociable person, this individual would score highly on both psychoticism and extraversion, respectively. Neuroticism is associated with high emotional arousal in stressful situations, so being able to keep calm in an emergency is a sign of low neuroticism. Conscientiousness, a trait associated with being hardworking and organized instead of impulsive, is not described by the question stem.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Many pets will run toward the kitchen when they hear the sound of a can opener opening a can of pet food. The sound of the can opener is a:
['conditioned response',
 'unconditioned response',
 'conditioned stimulus',
 'unconditioned stimulus']
C.) conditioned stimulus

The sound of a can opener would not normally produce a response on its own, making it a stimulus that must have been conditioned by association with the sound with food.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A young adult male claims to have had sexual relationships mostly with other men, although he has been attracted to women at times. What would be his most likely score on the Kinsey scale?
['0', '1', '5', '6']
C.) 5

This man is describing his sexuality as mostly homosexual, although he has also had some heterosexual attractions. The Kinsey scale scores a 6, choice (D), as exclusively homo-sexual. A score of 3 would equate to bisexuality. Thus, this man would likely score a 4 or 5.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Glucocorticoids have been implicated in stress-related weight gain because:
['they increase appetite and decrease satiety signals',
 'they increase the activity of catabolic hormones',
 'they increase glucose levels, which causes insulin secretion',
 'they interfere with the activity of the leptin receptor']
C.) they increase glucose levels, which causes insulin secretion

Short-term glucocorticoid exposure causes a release of glucose and the hydrolysis of fats from adipocytes. However, if this glucose is not used for metabolism, it causes an increase in glucose level which promotes fat storage. The net result is the release of glucose from the liver to be converted into lipids in the adipose tissue under insulin stimulation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is least likely to cause denaturation of proteins?
['Heating the protein to 100 degrees C',
 'Adding 8 M urea',
 'Moving it to a more hypotonic environment',
 'Adding a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate']
C.) Moving it to a more hypotonic environment

High salt concentrations and detergents can denature a protein, as can high temperatures. But moving a protein to a hypotonic environment—that is, a lower solute concentration— should not lead to denaturation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following characteristics is NOT attributed to antibodies?
['Antibodies bind to more than one distinct antigen.',
 'Antibodies label antigens for targeting by other immune cells.',
 'Antibodies can cause agglutination by interaction with antigen.',
 'Antibodies have two heavy chains and two light chains.']
A.) Antibodies bind to more than one distinct antigen.

Antibodies are specific to a single antigen. Each B-cell produces a single type of antibody with a constant region that is specific to the host and a variable region that is specific to an antigen.

A medical student is feeling a high level of stress due to upcoming exams and pressure from his family to engage in activities at home. He chooses to go the gym for a workout to help himself relax. This workout is which type of stress?
['Hassle', 'Frustration', 'Distress', 'Eustress']
D.) Eustress

A positive stressor creates eustress. Because working out is used to relax, it is considered a eustress. Hassle, choice (A), and frustration, choice (B), are both types of distress, choice (C), or negative stressors.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Where does β-oxidation of fatty acids occur within the cell?
['Cytosol', 'Mitochondria', 'Smooth endoplasmic reticulum', 'Plasma membrane']
D.) Plasma membrane

The liver is the major metabolic organ in the body and is responsible for much of the synthesis and interconversion of fuel sources. Most of the triacylglycerols that are synthesized in the liver are transported as VLDL to adipose tissue for storage. Both the adipocytes, choice (A) and dietary intake, choice (B), constitute a minor source of triacylglycerol.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

How does prokaryotic DNA differ from eukaryotic DNA?
['I only', 'IV only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III only']
D.) I, II, and III only

Prokaryotic DNA is circular and lacks histone proteins, and thus does not form nucleosomes. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA are replicated by DNA polymerases, although these polymerases differ in identity. Eukaryotic DNA is organized into chromatin, which can condense to form linear chromosomes; only prokaryotes have circular chromosomes. Only eukaryotic DNA has telomeres.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A 28-year-old male comes to a clinic concerned that he has pancreatic cancer. Review of his medical records shows that this is the fourth time in the past year that the patient has appeared for medical attention. No identifiable medical problem is found. When confronted with this history, he confesses that he feels relieved after being told that all of the tests are negative, but soon becomes worried again that he has cancer. Based on the information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient would be:
['major depressive disorder',
 'illness anxiety disorder',
 'conversion disorder',
 'narcissistic personality disorder']
B.) illness anxiety disorder

In illness anxiety disorder, the person is preoccupied with fears that he has—or will come down with—a serious disease, and these fears continue even after medical exams and tests have returned negative results.

['Preconventional; conventional',
 'Preconventional; postconventional',
 'Conventional; preconventional',
 'Postconventional; conventional']
A.) Preconventional; conventional

Matt's reasoning reflects a desire to avoid punishment, which reflects stage one in Kohlberg's preconventional phase (obedience). Cati's reasoning takes into account social order, reflecting stage four in the conventional phase (law and order).

Glen brings cookies to work. Although you have not yet tasted them, you say to another coworker, "Glen is such a great guy; I'm sure these cookies are fantastic!" What type of bias is this?
['Reliance on central traits', 'Direct benefits', 'Halo effect', 'Similarity']
C.) Halo effect

The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which judgments of an individual's character can be affected by the overall impression of the individual.

In high doses, aspirin functions as a mitochondrial uncoupler. How would this affect glycogen stores?
['It causes depletion of glycogen stores.',
 'It has no effect on glycogen stores.',
 'It promotes additional storage of glucose as glycogen.',
 'Its effect on glycogen stores varies from cell to cell.']
A.) It causes depletion of glycogen stores.

Uncouplers inhibit ATP synthesis without affecting the electron transport chain. Because the body must burn more fuel to maintain the proton-motive force, glycogen stores will be mobilized to feed into glycolysis, then the TCA, and finally oxidative phosphorylation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Photons and other energy sources can excite electrons into higher energy levels, though these excitations are typically short-lived. X-ray imaging succeeds because different tissue types are differently able to absorb the energy of a photon in order to excite an electron. Suppose an electron falls from n = 4 to its ground state, n = 1. Which of the following effects is most likely?
['A photon is absorbed.',
 'A photon is emitted.',
 'The electron moves into a p-orbital.',
 'The electron moves into a d-orbital.']
B.) A photon is emitted.

Because the electron is moving into the n = 1 shell, the only subshell available is the 1s subshell, which eliminates choices (C) and (D). There will be some energy change, however, as the electron must lose energy to return to the minimum-energy ground state. That will require emitting radiation in the form of a photon.

When practicing her recital song at home, a teenage girl sounds perfectly in pitch to her family and friends. However, when performing at the recital in front of a large audience of peers, strangers, and coaches, her pitch and tone are off, resulting in a poor performance. This second performance is best explained by:
['drive reduction theory',
 'instinct approach theory',
 "Maslow's hierarchy of needs",
 'the Yerkes-Dodson law']
D.) the Yerkes-Dodson law

The Yerkes-Dodson law states that there is an optimal level of arousal necessary to perform. If levels of arousal are too high, poor performance can result. In the case of the girl performing at her recital, her arousal level is very high as a result of nerves and anxiety, resulting in a poor performance.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Biochemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons produce electromotive force. Given the following standard reduction potentials, what is the standard electromotive force of the following reaction?
['-2.2 V', '-1.1 V', '+1.1', '+2.2']
B.) -1.1

-0.763 - 0.337 = -1.1

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A rat is trained to press a lever to obtain food under a fixed-interval schedule. Which of the following behaviors would the rat most likely exhibit?
['Pressing the lever continuously whenever it is hungry.',
 'Pressing the lever exactly once and waiting for the food pellet before '
 'pressing it again.',
 'Pressing the lever slowly at first, but with increasing frequency as the end '
 'of the interval approaches.',
 'None of the above; the association formed by fixed-interval schedules is too '
 'weak to increase behavior.']
C.) Pressing the lever slowly at first, but with increasing frequency as the end of the interval approaches.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A student is trying to determine the type of membrane transport occurring in a cell. She finds that the molecule to be transported is very large and polar, and when transported across the membrane, no energy is required. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of transport?
['Active transport', 'Simple diffusion', 'Facilitated diffusion', 'Exocytosis']
C.) Facilitated diffusion

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An alpha-helix is most likely to be held together by:
['disulfide bonds',
 'hydrophobic effects',
 'hydrogen bonds',
 'ion attractions between side chains']
C.) hydrogen bonds

 -------------------------------------------------- 

While on the phone, a friend says: "A good friend would let me borrow the bike." This friend is using which impression management strategy?
['Managing appearances', 'Alter-casting', 'Ingratiation', 'Self-disclosure']
B.) Alter-casting

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is used as a disinfectant and has also been shown to treat chronic skin inflammation. What is the oxidation number of chlorine in NaClO?
['-1', '0', '+1', '+2']
C.) +1

In NaClO (sodium hypochlorite), sodium carries its typical +1 charge, and oxygen carries its typical -2 charge. This means that chlorine atom must carry a +1 charge in order to balance the overall charge of zero.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A nine-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician. Her parents describe that any time she is startled, she appears to collapse and fall asleep. She also complains of waking up in the morning unable to move. Which sleep disorder should be suspected?
['Insomnia', 'Sleep deprivation', 'Narcolepsy', 'Sleep apnea']
C.) Narcolepsy

The patient and her parents are describing cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone and intrusion of REM sleep during the waking hours, usually in response to a startling or emotional trigger) and sleep paralysis (an inability to move despite being awake, usually when waking up in the morning). These symptoms are highly suggestive of narcolepsy; in fact, some consider cataplexy to be pathognomonic for (absolutely indicative of) the disorder.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, which of the following would be the most important for a recent college graduate to accomplish?
['Figuring out what identities are most important to him or her',
 'Feeling like a contributing member of society',
 'Forming an intimate relationship with a significant other',
 'Finding a feeling of accomplishment in his or her life']
C.) Forming an intimate relationship with a significant other

As a postadolescent young adult, this person would be described by Erikson as experiencing the conflict of intimacy vs. isolation, and so forming significant relationships with others would be a primary goal. Choices (B) and (D) represent the next two stages in life (generativity vs. stagnation and integrity vs. despair, respectively), while choice (A) is the conflict that Erikson would say should have been resolved in adolescence (identity vs. role confusion).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Humans have evolved to notice patterns and shapes. A corporate logo uses five unconnected angles equally spaced in a circular fashion. When viewed, it appears to be a star. Which of the following is the logo artist using to create a complete pattern to viewers?
['Bottom-up processing',
 'Top-down processing',
 'Gate theory',
 'Gestalt principles']
D.) Gestalt principles

Gestalt principles are the basis for many optical illusions and include the tendency of people to see continuity even when lines are unconnected. Specifically, this logo appears to rely on the law of closure to create on complete star from five nontouching angles.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In some cultures, it is considered taboo for one to show too much sadness at a funeral. In other cultures, wailing and crying loudly is expected. These cultures differ in their:
['characteristic institutions',
 'display rules',
 'authentic selves',
 'peer groups']
B.) display rules

Display rules are those that dictate cultural expectations of emotion. In some cultures, sadness is considered personal and internal; in others, sadness is shared externally with the community.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Charged molecules are often sequested within cellular compartments due to their difficulting passing through the hydrophobic interior of phospholipid bilayers. A positive charge on the molecule shown would have greater stability than a positive charge on a straight-chain alkane version of the same molecule. What property most explains this effect?
['Steric hindrance', 'Nitrogen electronegativity', 'Induction', 'Conjugation']
D.) Conjugation
This molecule is more stable with a positive charge than a straight-chain alkane due to the conjugation of the benzene ring. This permits delocalization of the charge through resonance. Although induction, choice (C), does have an effect on the stabilization of the molecule, this effect is much less significant than the impact of having a conjugated system. The electronegativity of nitrogen, choice (B), which primarily affects induction, is also not a vital component of the stabilization by this molecule of a positive charge because oxygen is more electronegative. Steric hindrance, choice (A), would affect the reactivity of a molecule, but not its ability to stabilize charge.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When you first meet Dustin, he is very rude to you. You run into him twice more and he is very friendly, but you still dislike him because of your first meeting. What impression bias does this describe?
['Primacy effect', 'Recency effect', 'Reliance on central traits', 'Proximity']
A.) Primacy effect

The impressions we form when meeting others are influenced by a number of perceptual biases. The primacy effect refers to those occasions when first impressions are more important than subsequent impressions.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements regarding fetal circulation is FALSE?
['In the umbilical cord, there are more arteries than veins.',
 'The foramen ovale is the only shunt that connects two chambers of the heart.',
 'Blood flow in the ductus arteriosus is from the aorta to the pulmonary '
 'artery.',
 'The ductus venosus is the only shunt that bypasses the liver.']
C.) Blood flow in the ductus arteriosus is from the aorta to the pulmonary artery.

Blood flow in the ductus arteriosus is from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The direction of flow is determined by the pressure differential between the right side of the heart (and pulmonary circulation) vs. the left side of the heart (and systemic circulation). Unlike in adults, the right side of the heart is at a higher pressure during prenatal life than the left side, so blood will shunt from the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation through both the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The many steps of glycolysis all exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium between reactant and product concentrations. Which of the following actions does NOT affect the equilibrium position of a reaction?
['Adding or subtracting heat',
 'Adding or removing a catalyst',
 'Increasing or decreasing concentrations of reactants.',
 'Increasing or decreasing volumes of reactants']
B.) Adding or removing a catalyst

The equilibrium of a reaction can be changed by several factors. Adding or subtracting heat, choice (A), would shift the equilibrium based on the enthalpy change of the reaction. Increasing reactant concentrations would shift the equilibrium in the direction of the product, and the opposite would occur if reactant concentrations were decreased, eliminating choice (C). Changing the volume of a reactant would affect any reaction with gaseous reactants or products, eliminating choice (D). While adding or removing a catalyst would change the reaction rate, it would not change where the equilibrium lies.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

After sitting in a lecture, determining that a professor is a bad teacher based on their unprofessional attire and monotone speech is an example of which type of processing?
['Knowledge route processing',
 'Adaptive route processing',
 'Central route processing',
 'Peripheral route processing']
D.) Peripheral route processing 

Peripheral route processing deals with processing information that is not based on content, but instead on superficial parameters such as boring speech patterns or appearance of the speaker. Central route processing, choice (C), is the processing of information through analysis of its content.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Biologically important carboxylic acids include pyruvic acid, citric acid, and the C-terminus of amino acid chains. Which of the following carboxylic acids will be the most acidic?
['CH3CHClCH2COOH', 'CH3CH2CCl2COOH', 'CH3CH2CHClCOOH', 'CH3CH2CH2COOH']
B.) CH3CH2CCl2COOH

The acidity of carboxylic acids is significantly increased by the presence of highly electronegative functional groups. Their electron-withdrawing effect increases the stability of the carboxylate anion, favoring proton dissociation. This effect increases as the number of electronegative groups on the chain increases, and it also increases as the distance between the acid functionality and electronegative group decreases. This answer has two halogens bound to it, at a smaller distance from the carboxyl group compared to the other answers.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a toxic pollutant that has been implicated as a risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The following system obeys second-order kinetics:
['Rate = k[NO2][CO]',
 'Rate = k[NO2]^2[CO]',
 'Rate = k[NO2][NO3]',
 'Rate = k[NO2]^2']
D.) Rate = k[NO2]^2

To answer this question, recall that the slow step of a reaction is the rate-determining step. The rate is always related to the concentrations of the reactants in the rate-determining step (not the overall reaction), so NO2 is the only compound that should be included in the correct answer. The concentration of NO2 is squared in the rate law because the stoichiometric coefficient of NO2 in the rate-determining step is 2.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a method by which enzymes decrease the activation energy for biological reactions?
['Modifying the local charge environment',
 'Forming transient covalent bonds',
 'Acting as electron donors or receptors',
 'Breaking bonds in the enzyme to provide energy']
D.) Breaking bonds in the enzyme to provide energy

Enzymes are not altered by the process of catalysis. A molecule that breaks intramolecular bonds to provide activation energy would not be able to be reused.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Glucocorticoids have been implicated in stress-related weight gain because:
['they increase appetite and decrease satiety signals',
 'they increase the activity of catabolic hormones',
 'they increase glucose levels, which causes insulin secretion',
 'they interfere with activity of the leptin receptor']
C.) they increase glucose levels, which causes insulin secretion

Short-term glucocorticoid exposure causes a release of glucose and the hydrolysis of fats from adipocytes. However, if this glucose is not used for metabolism, it causes an increase in glucose level which promotes fat storage. The net result is the release of glucose from the liver to be converted into lipids in the adipose tissue under insulin stimulation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is a false statement regarding erythrocytes?
['They contain hemoglobin.',
 'They are anaerobic.',
 "Their nuclei are located in the middle of the cells' disk-like depressions.",
 'They are phagocytized in the spleen and liver after a certain period of '
 'time.']
C. 
-Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are produced in the red bone marrow and circulate in the blood for about 120 days, after which they are phagocytized in the spleen and the liver. Red blood cells have a disk-like shape and lose their membranous organelles, like mitochondria and nuclei, during maturation. Erythrocytes thus cannot multiply on their own and are anaerobic. Their main role is the transport of oxygen to the tissues and of the carbon dioxide to the lungs; this task is accomplished through the use of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen and limited amount of carbon dioxide.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the correct sequence of a cardiac impulse?
['SA node - AV node - Purkinje fibers - bundle of His - ventricles',
 'AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - SA node - ventricles - atria',
 'SA node - atria - AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles',
 'SA node - AV node - atria - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles']
C.
-An ordinary cardiac contraction originates in, and is regulated by, the sinoatrial (SA) node. The impulses travel through both atria, stimulating them to contract simultaneously. The impulse then arrives at the atrioventricular (AV) node, which momentarily slows conduction, allowing for completion of atrial contraction and ventricular filling. The impulse is then carried by the bundle of His, which branches into the right and left bundle branches and through the Purkinje fibers in the walls of both ventricles, generating a strong contraction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hemoglobin's affinity for Oxygen (O2):
['increases in exercising muscle tissue.',
 'decreases as blood pH increases.',
 'decreases as blood pH decreases.',
 'is higher in maternal blood than in fetal blood.']
C.
-According to the Bohr effect, decreasing pH in the blood decreases hemoglobin's affinity for O2. A decrease in pH of the blood generally occurs during heavy exercise, when the muscles produce a lot of lactic acid. This decreased affinity for O2 facilitates the unloading of O2 to tissues in need. Hemoglobin's affinity for O2 is higher in fetal blood than in adult blood.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following correctly traces the circulatory pathway?
['Superior vena cava - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary artery - '
 'lungs - pulmonary veins - left atrium - left ventricle - aorta.',
 'Superior vena cava - left atrium - left ventricle - pulmonary artery - lungs '
 '- pulmonary veins - right atrium - right ventricle - aorta.',
 'Aorta - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary artery - lungs - '
 'pulmonary veins - left atrium - left ventricle - superior vena cava.',
 'Superior vena cava - right atrium - right ventricle - pulmonary veins - '
 'lungs - pulmonary artery - left atrium - left ventricle - aorta.']
A. 
-Blood drains from the superior vena cava into the right atrium. It passes through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, and then through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It flows through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, it is pumped through the aortic valve into the aorta for distribution throughout the body.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The tri-cuspid valve prevents backflow of blood from the:
['left ventricle into the left atrium',
 'aorta into the left ventricle',
 'pulmonary artery into the right ventricle',
 'right ventricle into the right atrium']
D.
-The atrioventricular valves are located between the atria and the ventricles on both sides of the heart. Their role is to prevent backflow of blood into the atria. The valve on the right side of the heart has three cusps and is called the tricuspid valve. As such, it prevents backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium. The valve on the left side of heart has two cusps and is called the bicuspid or mitral valve. The mitral valve prevents backflow from the left ventricle into the left atrium.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At the venous end of a capillary bed, the osmotic pressure:
['is greater than the hydrostatic pressure',
 'results in a net outflow of fluid',
 'results in a net reabsorption of fluid into the blood',
 'both A and C']
D.
-The exchange of materials is greatly influenced by the relative balance between the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of blood and tissue fluids. The osmotic pressure of the surrounding tissue remains constant. However, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end is greater than the hydrostatic pressure at the venous end. As a result, fluid moves out of the capillaries at the arterial end and back in a the venous end. Fluid is reabsorbed at the venous end because the osmotic pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A patient's chart reveals that he has a cardiac output of 7,500 mL/min and a stroke volume of 50 mL. What is his pulse, in beats per minute?
['50 beats/min', '100 beats/min', '150 beats/min', '400 beats/min']
C. 
-Cardiac output equals heart rate times stroke volume. We are given stroke volume and cardiac output, so we can use heart rate equals cardiac output divided by stroke volume.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An unconscious patient is rushed into the emergency room and needs an immediate blood transfusion. Because there is no time to check her medical history or determine her blood type, which type of blood should you, as her doctor, give her?
['A-', 'AB+', 'O+', 'O-']
D.
-Without knowing a patient's blood type, the only type of transfusion that we can safely give is O-. People with O-blood are considered universal donors because their blood cells contain no surface antigens. Therefore, O- blood can be given to anyone without causing potentially life threatening consequences.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is true regarding arteries and veins?
['Arteries are thin-walled, muscular, and elastic, whereas veins are '
 'thick-walled and inelastic.',
 'Arteries always conduct oxygenated blood, whereas veins always carry '
 'deoxygenated blood.',
 'The blood pressure in the aorta is always higher than the pressure in the '
 'superior vena cava.',
 'Arteries facilitate blood transport by using skeletal muscle contractions, '
 'whereas veins make use of pumping of the heart to push blood.']
C.
-The pressure in the aorta is usually about 120 or 80 mmHg, depending on whether the heart is in systole or diastole, whereas the pressure in the superior vena cava is extremely low. Choice (A) is incorrect because arteries are thick walled and veins are thin walled. Choice (B) is also incorrect; this relationships is reversed in pulmonary circulation. Choice (D) is opposite. Arteries make use of the pumping of the heart and the "snapping back" of their elastic walls to transport blood, whereas venous blood is "pumped" by skeletal muscle contractions.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At any given time, there is more blood in the venous system than in the arterial system. Which of the following features of a vein allows this?
['Relative lack of smooth muscle in the wall',
 'Presence of valves',
 'Proximity of veins to lymphatic vessels',
 'Thin endothelial lining']
A.
-The relative lack of smooth muscle in venous walls allows stretching to store most of the blood in the body. Valves in the veins allow for one-way flow of blood toward the heart. Both arteries and veins are close to lymphatic vessels, which has no bearing on their relative difference in volume. Both arteries and veins have a thin endothelial lining.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is involved in the body's primary blood-buffering mechanism?
['Fluid intake',
 'Absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal system',
 'Carbon dioxide produced from metabolism',
 'Reabsorption in the kidney']
C.
-Carbon dioxide is a by-product of metabolism in cells, which later combines with water to form bicarbonate in a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. This system is blood plasma's most important buffer system. Food and fluid absorption are not significant sources of buffering.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A study is conducted in which participants are asked to watch a video of a person stealing money from a blind homeless person on the street while people passing by notice and do nothing. Despite seeing almost nobody confront the thief on the video, the participants overwhelmingly indicate they would have intervened. The participants' responses best illustrate which of the following?
['modeling',
 'social loafing',
 'bystander effect',
 'fundamental attribution error']
D Fundamental attribution error = discount situational factors when interpreting others' actions. In this case, study ppts attribute lack of action to personal feelings rather than external factors

A modelling = type of observational learning

B social loafing = doing less work when surrounded by others than would do alone

C bystander effect = the people who walk by and do not intervene in the presence of others. but the study ppts are not bystander effect because they are not actual witness

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The lymphatic system uses skeletal muscle movements to help force interstitial fluids through the lymph system. During periods of prolonged inactivity, which of the following results could be expected as a result of the inactive lymph system?
['an increase in urine production',
 'a disturbance in circadian rhythm',
 'hypersensitivity to allergens',
 'a drop in blood pressure']
D Lymph system captures interstitial fluid and returns fluid to circulation, preventing loss of blood volume and avoiding the swelling of tissues (edema). Inactivity -> lack of pump, interstitial fluid build up in tissues, loss of blood volume, drop in blood pressure

Urine production would drop bc less flood filtered
no link between circadian rhythm and lymphatic system
hypersensitivity mediated by IgE, present in mucosa, not directly affected by lack of re circulation of interstitial fluids

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A cell which lacks a nucleus can do all of the following except
['convert glucose into energy',
 'regulate intracellular ion concentrations',
 'be entered by a virus',
 'respond to steroid hormones']
Steroids act directly within the nucleus of cells, therefore for cells without a nucleus (e.g. red blood cells), a steroid hormone would have no effect. the conversion of glucose to energy (A) is true because glycolysis occurs outside the nucleus. regulation of intracellular ion concentration (B) is accurate because transmembrane proteins regulate intracellular ion concentrations and do not rely on the nucleus. (C) is also correct because viruses only need a cell membrane in order to be able to enter a cell.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Prion diseases are the result of misfolded proteins produced from normal proteins. As the proteins become misfolded, they induce normal proteins to become misfolded as well. This results in an exponential increase in misfolded proteins. This is an example of which of the following?
['feedback inhibition',
 'positive feedback loop',
 'induced-fit hypothesis',
 'lock-and-key hypothesis']
positive feedback loops: product of reaction increases the production of that product. typ: exponential increase. 

negative feedback = feedback inhibition = product decreases own production -> stabilization of product levels

C/D enzyme-substrate bonding

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An object is placed infinitely far away from a biconcave lens. Which of the following holds true?
['The lens will act exactly the same as a biconvex lens',
 'The image will appear on the same side of the lens as the object',
 'The image will appear exactly the focal length in front of the lens',
 'Light will not converge and thus no image will be formed']
the thin lens equation can be utilized where 1/F = 1/S1 + 1/S2 where the S values represent the distance the object is away from the lens and the distance the image is from the lens (respectively). We can set S1 to be infinite, thus we get that F (focal length) = S2, thus (C) is the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following represents the correct ground state electronic configuration for Fe3+?
['1s22s22p63s23p63d6',
 's22s22p63s23p63d34s2',
 's22s22p63s23p63d44s1',
 '1s22s22p63s23p63d5']
Iron is special electronic config. remove electrons from the 4s orbital and THEN the 3d orbital

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements accurately describes the difference between a sigma (σ) and a pi (π) bond?
['Pi bonds form from the side-to-side overlap of hybridized sp, sp^2, sp^3 '
 'superscript orbitals.',
 'Sigma bonds form from the end-to-end overlap of two hybridized s or p '
 'orbitals.',
 'The maximum number of σ versus π bonds between two atoms are different, but '
 'the energy level of the two bonds are the same.',
 'Only sigma bonds use hybridized orbitals to overlap in forming the bond.']
Only sigma bonds use hybridized orbitals to overlap in forming the bond.

In regards to the total possible number of bonds between two atoms, the total possible number of bonds for a σ bond is one and for a π bond is two. In regards to the energy level, a sigma bond is lower in energy than a π bond.

A sigma σ bond will form from an end-to-end overlap of an s, p, or hybridized orbital.

A π bond will only form from the side-to-side overlap of two unhybridized p orbitals.

Since π bonds only use unhybridized orbitals, only sigma bonds use hybridized orbitals to overlap in forming the bond. It is the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following best describes a chemical species that is measured to have Kb = 3.2 x 10^-18?
['strong b']
A strong acid

Whether a chemical is an acid or base depends on whether Ka or Kb is greater

Because Ka x Kb = Kw, Ka = 2.3 x 10^3, suggesting that it is an acid

Because Ka >> 1, it is a strong acid

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If an archaebacterial species lives in a pool that is 0.01 M HCl(aq), what is the pH of the water?
['12', '6', '2', '0.01']
2
The pH of a solution is defined as the -log[H+]. The strong acid HCl completely dissociates in water, so an HCl concentration of 0.01M means that the H+ concentration is 0.01 M (10^-2), and the pH is 2.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A solution contains 7.15g of Na2CO3 x 10 H20. How many sodium ions are in the initial 50mL solution of Na2CO3?
['1.50 x 10^22', '3.00 x 10^22', '6.02 x 10^23', '12.0 x 10^23']
3.00 x 10^22
(7.15g) x (1 mol/286.14g) = 0.025 mol. Because each mole of Na2CO3 x 10 H20 contains 2 mol Na+, there is 0.05 mol Na+. Using Avagadro's number, the number of sodium ions is (0.05mol)(6.022x10^23 ions/mol) = 3.01 x 10^22 ions

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A student uses thin layer chromatography on silica plates to monitor the progress of a reaction of a ketone to an alcohol. Does the product (alcohol) have a higher or lower Rf that the starting material?
['Higher, because the product if more polar than the starting material',
 'Higher, because the product if less polar than the starting material',
 'Lower, because the product if less polar than the starting material',
 'Lower, because the product if more polar than the starting material']
Lower, because the product if more polar than the starting material
Because of the OH group on the alcohol, the product interacts with the silica more strongly than the starting material and has a lower Rf than the ketone.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

According to trends in electronegativity, which of the following pairs of atoms is most likely to form an ionic bond?
['and']
Ca and I
An ionic bond is likely to form between elements of very high and very low electronegativity. In practice this generally means elements at the far right and far left of the periodic table.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Ba^2+ is an ion that is very toxic to mammals when taken internally. Which of the following compounds, mixed in water, would be the safest if accidentally swallowed?
['BaSO4, Ksp = 1.1 x 10^-10',
 'BaCO3, Ksp = 8.1 x 10^-9',
 'BaSO3, Ksp = 8.0 x 10^-7',
 'BaF2, Ksp = 1.7 x 10^-6']
BaSO4, Ksp = 1.1 x 10^-10
The lower the value of Ksp is, the loewr the concentrations of the cation and anion in an aqueous solution and the lower the solubility of the compound in water. If mixed with water and accidentally swallowed, the Ba salt with the lowest Ksp would be the safest.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hydrocarbons of varying lengths and shapes form fatty acids and other structural compounds. Does a linear or branched hydrocarbon have a higher boiling point and why?
['linear because linear, unbranched alkanes experience more surface area '
 'contact than comparable branched alkanes and have greater Van der Waals '
 'forces acting on them.',
 'linear because the atom pairs in octane have a smaller electronegativity '
 'difference than those in 2,3,4-trimethylpentane.',
 'branched because the boiling point of an alkane is inversely proportional to '
 'chain length and directly proportional to number of substituents.',
 'branched because the increased branching gives the molecule a greater net '
 'dipole moment than n-octane.']
A.
A general rule of thumb is that increased branching decreases the boiling point of any particular alkane due to sterics; thus, Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect. n-Octane (left molecule), being linear and having more places to interact with other molecules through van der Waals forces, has a higher boiling point than 2,3,4-trimethylpentane (right molecule.) Choice (B) is incorrect because the electronegativity difference between C-H bonds in different alkane isomers are the same, or any differences are negligible.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which one of the following has the highest boiling point?
['Water', 'Methane', 'Acetic Acid', 'Acetone']
Question 10: C
This question is asking for the molecule with the highest boiling point among the answer
choices. There are three things to take into account when measuring relative boiling points:
1) Molecular weight. Higher molecular weight makes for a higher boiling point.
2) Intermolecular forces. More intermolecular forces, especially hydrogen bonds,
increase the boiling point.
3) Branching. More branching in a molecule's structure will lower its boiling point,
because a lower surface area will reduce London dispersion forces.
Execute (Eliminate): ​Looking at the answer choices, we can tell that branching will not be a big
factor in this problem, so we will focus on molecular weight and hydrogen bonding.
(A)​, water, exhibits hydrogen bonding, but has a low molecular weight.
(B)​, methane, has both a low molecular weight and does not exhibit hydrogen bonding.
(C)​, acetic acid, exhibits hydrogen bonding and has a higher molecular weight than water.
(D)​, acetone, has a high molecular weight, but it is lower than acetic acid and it does not exhibit
hydrogen bonding.
Of the two compounds that exhibit hydrogen bonding (water and acetic acid), acetic acid wins
out with the higher boiling point because of its higher molecular weight. Thus, (C) ​is correct

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following elements releases energy when converted to a negatively charged ion?
['I only', 'III only', 'I and III only', 'I, II, and III']
Question 11: D
This question is asking for element(s) that release energy when converted into negatively
charged ions. Going from neutral to negatively charged means the atom gains an electron and
releases energy. The change in energy associated with this process is called electron affinity.
The answer choices are all different combinations of Roman numerals, which refer to three
different atoms to consider: C, Na and Br.
Execute (Predict): ​The amount of energy released will vary depending on the stability of the
resulting anion, with nonmetals, especially halogens, having generally higher electron affinities
(more energy released) than metals. However, since all atoms have a positive nucleus, the
addition of an electron to a neutral atom, other things being equal, will always release energy.
This means that even though some are much more likely to accept an electron than others, all
the elements on this list have an exergonic first electron affinity, and thus (D) ​is correct.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following would most likely occur if a saturated solution of Fe(OH)2 at 150C is subsequently reduced in temperature to 50C?
['No change',
 'Additional dissolution',
 'Fe(OH)2 precipitation',
 'Equilibrium is achieved']
Fe(OH)2 precipitation

a decrease in temp causes a decrease in Ksp, so the saturated solution is now supersaturated 
supersaturated solution tend to precipitate in order ot reach equilibrium

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If the average bone mineral density is 3.88 g/cm3, which of the following is a reasonable estimation of the specific gravity of fats in the body? 
['0.09', '2.7', '4.2', '9.1']
B. 2.7
Fats are less dense than bone and should therefore have a density smaller than 3.88 g/cm3. Specific gravity is the ratio of a material's density to the density of water (1 g/cm3). Since fats are less dense than bone, we can conclude that the specific gravity of fats is less than 3.88. This conclusion eliminates choices C and D. Choice A is a very small number; the difference between the densities of bone and fat is not that large. We're left with choice B.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

While solving a chemistry problem, a student uses the equation ΔG = -nFE to determine that the ΔG = -178 kJ/mol. Which of the following must be true about this reaction? 
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II', 'I, II, and III']
A. I only

-rxn is exothermic is determined by deta H, not delta G

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Many processes in living cells produce free radicals. All of these molecules can perform an antioxidant function in vivo EXCEPT: 
['']
D. FAD. 
FAD is the oxidized form of the electron carrier FADH2, so it does not act as a reducing agent (an electron donor) in vivo.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Fats are stored in adipose tissues primarily as: 
['fatty acids.', 'chylomicrons.', 'glycerol.', 'triacylglycerides.']
triacylglycerides

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Within the body, which of the following blood vessels is expected to have the greatest total cross-sectional area and the lowest flow rate? 
['The aorta', 'The arterioles', 'The capillaries', 'The vena cava']
the capillaries

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A cell in which an elevated ATP-to-ADP ratio exists is most likely to demonstrate what allosteric effect resulting from this elevation? 
['Inhibition of pyruvate kinase',
 'Activation of phosphofructokinase-1',
 'Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase',
 'Activation of hexokinase']
A is correct. Pyruvate kinase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the final step of glycolysis, is allosterically inhibited by ATP. The enzyme would thus be inhibited by a high cellular ATP-to-ADP ratio.

B: Phosphofructokinase-1, another glycolytic enzyme, is inhibited by ATP.

C: The enzyme ATP citrate lyase is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. It is not allosterically regulated by ATP, but is primarily controlled through insulin- and glucagon-mediated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. However, in general, it tends to be in an active state under conditions where the cellular ATP-to-ADP ratio is high.

D: Hexokinase, a glycolytic enzyme, is not directly allosterically regulated by ATP, but tends to be in an active state under conditions where the cellular ATP-to-ADP ratio is high.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess desaturases which can increase membrane fluidity by adding a cis-double bond to a fatty acid chain on a phospholipid. What is the primary intermolecular force acting between adjacent fatty acid chains in a cell membrane? 
['']
london dispersion forces

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following structures develop from the mesoderm of the gastrula? 
['']
II and III only

C is correct. The mesodermal germ layer eventually differentiates into the kidneys (and its associated ducts), gonads (and its associated ducts), heart, blood vessels, and blood cells, as well as muscle and bone. A helpful mnemonic is "means-o-derm" for the mesoderm, because most systems that move things around the body will be derived from this layer.
 
I: The endoderm gives rise to the respiratory tract.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Given the role of the reaction in cellular respiration, what is the most likely Eº value for the reduction of oxygen to water? 
['']
0.82 V

B is correct. Positive Eº values correspond to compounds that are readily reduced. As the final electron acceptor in the ETC, oxygen must be more prone to reduction than any of the other electron carriers. In addition, a positive Eº value means that the associated reaction is spontaneous (in other words, it has a negative free energy change and releases energy). Since metabolic respiration (MR) is a biological process that is designed to produce energy for the cell, we know that the reactions that drive it must be net energy producers.
 
A: This answer is unlikely, given that it is very close to 0. Such a value does not fit with the idea of oxygen as a strong oxidizing agent.
C, D: Negative values correspond to compounds that are not spontaneously reduced.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is the MOST plausible explanation for a patient experiencing hypoglycemia? 
['']
A is correct. Insulin decreases the blood glucose level by increasing its uptake by cells. Thus, self-injection of excess insulin decreases the blood glucose level significantly, leading to hypoglycemia.
 
B: Gluconeogenesis produces glucose from other precursors. Increased gluconeogenesis leads to increased glucose production and, therefore, would cause hyperglycemia.
C: In frequent and prolonged fasting, the blood becomes gradually deprived of glucose, which leads to hypoglycemia. This is unlikely to result from a relatively short fast following the consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal.
D: Glyogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen, yields glucose 6-phosphate, which, in turn, gets converted to glucose. Therefore, increased rate of glyogenolysis leads to increased blood glucose levels.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In a metabolic analysis experiment, researchers subjected fatty acid samples to ß-oxidation. Mass spectrometry performed on the resulting products would reveal: 
['']
acetyl coA

B is correct. The ß-oxidation of fatty acids is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. The acetyl-CoA can then enter the citric acid cycle, while NADH and FADH2 can serve as coenzymes used in the electron transport chain.
 
A, C, D: These are not products of the ß-oxidation of fatty acids.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following cell types performs functions in the central nervous system analogous to Schwann cells? 
['Chondrocytes', 'Microglia', 'Oligodendrocytes', 'Ependymal cells']
C is correct. Oligodendrocytes provide myelination in the central nervous system in a manner similar to Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system.
 
A: Chondrocytes produce cartilage.
B: Microglia are a type of macrophage.
D: Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In what order do electrons move through the ETC? 
['From carriers with lower reduction potential to carriers with higher '
 'reduction potential',
 'From carriers with higher reduction potential to carriers with lower '
 'reduction potential',
 'From carriers with stronger proton binding capacity to carriers with weaker '
 'proton binding capacity',
 'From carriers with weaker proton binding capacity to carriers with stronger '
 'proton binding capacity']
A is correct. In the ETC, the movement of electrons between carriers is used to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane; this allows ATP synthase to generate ATP for the cell. For electrons to move properly through the chain, each carrier must "want" to be reduced more than the one before it, or the electron transfer would not be energetically favorable. The more a carrier wants to be reduced, the higher its reduction potential. Thus, electrons move from carriers with lower reduction potential to those with higher reduction potential. 
 
C, D: Although some of the carriers in the ETC are responsible for pumping protons across the mitochondrial membrane, not all are. In addition, the movement of electrons is driven by reduction potential and not proton binding. These answers are meant to tempt you because the proton gradient is an important part of the ETC, but a solid content base and careful reading will help you avoid them.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

All of the following are functions of insulin EXCEPT: 
['increasing glycogen synthesis.',
 'increasing gluconeogenesis.',
 'increasing glucose uptake by liver and muscles.',
 'decreasing proteolysis.']
B is correct. Gluconeogenesis produces glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. Insulin increases the glucose level in cells. Thus, there is less need for gluconeogenesis. 
 
A: Insulin increases the uptake of glucose by cells. The excess glucose is stored in glycogen for later use.
C: Insulin increases the uptake of glucose by cells such as liver and muscle cells. 
D: Insulin decreases the breakdown of proteins, proteolysis.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Each cycle of mitochondrial ß-oxidation liberates a two-carbon acetyl-CoA unit as well as which, if any, other molecule(s)? 
['NADH and FADH2', 'NADH only', 'FADH2 only', 'Neither NADH nor FADH2']
A is correct. One turn of the ß-oxidative cycle for an even-chain fatty acid results in the production of a single molecule of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. 

B, C, D: In addition to acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH2 are produced.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Infection by the hepatitis C virus may result in chronic disease and permanent damage to the liver. If liver function is impaired, synthesis of which of the following molecules found in human blood and isolated in Experiment 1 would LEAST likely be affected in adults? 
['Steroid hormones and antibodies',
 'VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL, and chylomicrons',
 'Antibodies, fatty acids, and steroid hormones',
 'Antibodies only']
D is correct. Fatty acid and sterol synthesis, including synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol-derived steroid hormones, occurs in the liver. The synthesis of these products, which comprise much of the content of plasma lipoproteins produced in both the liver and small intestine, would be affected along with that of the plasma lipoproteins (choices A, B and C are incorrect). Only antibody production (choice D) would be unaffected, as they are synthesized by plasma B cells. B cells are produced in the bone marrow and terminally differentiate into plasma cells in, most typically, the lymph nodes.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Newly formed chylomicrons involved in the transport of intestinally absorbed lipids immediately pass from cells of the duodenum into: 
['lacteals contained within intestinal villi.',
 'capillaries perfusing intestinal villi.',
 'lacteals passing through the serous lining of the abdominal cavity.',
 'capillaries supplying the muscular layer of the duodenum.']
A is correct. Chylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to cardiac, adipose, and skeletal muscle tissue, where lipoprotein lipase removes their triglyceride components by hydrolysis. Nascent chylomicrons are formed in enterocytes (columnar epithelial absorptive cells present in the small intestine) and released into lacteals (lymphatic vessels) originating in the small intestinal villi (choice A). 

B, D: Chylomicrons will not enter the bloodstream from lymphatic circulation until reaching the junction of the thoracic duct and left subclavian vein.
C: The lumen of the small intestine is not in direct communication with the serous membrane lining the abdominal cavity—the peritoneum.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Why was staining in petri dish A only visible during mitotic stages other than interphase? 
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
B is correct. (I) and (II) are largely equivalent; both state that chromatin protein - which is stained in petri dish A - must condense to a certain critical density and size before it can be observed with a microscope. Supercoiling of DNA, which is mediated by euchromatin protein, causes sufficient euchromatin to be consolidated to be microscopically observable. This makes (B) correct.

III: This describes something that never occurs, either during interphase or any other time. Chromatin never becomes translucent.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What component can best be expected to experience the same type of heavy staining as occurs in petri dish A to the nuclei peripheries and chromosome ends? 
['The center of each chromosome pair, since most histones are located there.',
 'The arms of each chromosome pair, since most histones are located there.',
 'The center of each chromosome pair, since chromosomal centromeres are made '
 'of heterochromatin.',
 'The center of each chromosome pair, since chromosomal centromeres are made '
 'of euchromatin.']
C is correct. Heterochromatin stains more heavily than euchromatin does, and centromeres are made of heterochromatin.

A: Most histones are located on the arms, not the center, and would not stain heavily in any event since they are made of euchromatin.
B: Although most histones are located on the arms, they are made of euchromatin and would not stain as heavily as would heterochromatin.
D: Incorrect; centromeres are not made of euchromatin.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

DCCD is a chemical that blocks the proton pore of ATP synthase. If treated with DCCD, which of the following is most likely to decrease in the actively respiring mitochondria of adult rat cardiac cells? 
['H+ concentration within the intermembrane space',
 'ADP concentration within the matrix',
 'Oxygen consumption',
 'Chemiosmotic gradient across the inner membrane']
C is correct. If, because of DCCD, protons are unable to return to the matrix through the ATP synthase proton pore, the proton gradient of the intermembrane space will increase, making translocation of additional protons into this space by the ETC increasingly less favorable. This will reduce the rate of electron transport through, and oxygen consumption by, the ETC. This conclusion is consistent with choice C only.
 
A: Following treatment, H+ concentration within the intermembrane space is likely to increase.
B: ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase F1 depends on proton movement through the F0 proton pore. Absent this movement, ATP synthesis will decline and ADP concentration in the matrix will increase.
D: The chemiosmotic gradient refers to the dual electrical and chemical gradient established across the inner mitochondrial matrix by electron transport. In the absence of a pathway for protons to return down this gradient into the matrix, the chemiosmotic gradient would be expected to increase.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A couple trying to conceive without using IVF methods would most likely have their highest chance of pregnancy: 
['early in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.',
 'after the onset of menses.',
 'during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.',
 'midway through the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.']
C is correct. This is the only option in which the egg would be even be accessible to the sperm. More specifically, during the luteal phase, the egg would be traveling down the Fallopian tube until it reached the uterus. If it were fertilized, it would implant in the uterine wall at that point.

A, D: The egg has not yet left the ovary in these choices, and therefore, the sperm would not be able to access it.
B: It is possible that the egg could have already left the uterus with the endometrial shedding in this choice.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following best explains why high blood levels of ketone bodies lower blood pH? 
['Because acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid have pKas above '
 'physiological pH',
 'Because production of ketone bodies produces CO2, which reacts with water to '
 'form carbonic acid',
 'Because production of ketone bodies releases coenzyme A, which is highly '
 'acidic',
 'Because acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid have pKas below '
 'physiological pH']
D is correct. This question is asking us to determine the most likely reason that ketone bodies would decrease the pH. Obviously, two of the three are acids, so the most logical explanation is simply that they are donating protons and decreasing the pH directly. This occurs when the pKas of the molecules are below physiological pH.
 
A: A pKa above physiological pH means that the acid will not be deprotonated.
B: It is true that the conversion of acetoacetate to acetone produces CO2, but the passage states that this only occurs after some time. Thus, it is not as direct a mechanism for lowering the pH as choice D.
C: This choice is incorrect because we are given no information about coenzyme A, and it is not likely to be so acidic as to cause a change in physiological pH.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Would a person with diabetes be at a greater risk of developing ketoacidosis? 
['Yes, because lack of insulin means lack of glucose in liver cells, halting '
 'the Krebs cycle and causing an overabundance of acetyl-CoA, resulting in '
 'ketogenesis and ketoacidosis.',
 'No, because lack of insulin means abundance of glucose in blood, meaning '
 'there is plenty of glucose available to enter the Krebs cycle as pyruvate.',
 'No, lack of insulin means lack of glucose in liver cells, however, the Krebs '
 'cycle will not be interrupted even without pyruvate.',
 'Yes, because lack of insulin means an abundance of glucose in blood, '
 'resulting in higher acetyl-CoA levels, which then undergo ketogenesis, '
 'resulting in ketoacidosis.']
A is correct. This question is asking us to remember what changes occur in a patient with diabetes and how those might contribute or not to ketoacidosis. Diabetes patients cannot produce insulin and might have high blood glucose and low levels of glucose in the cells. Thus, liver cells will lack the machinery to undergo the Krebs cycle but will still be able to obtain plenty of acetyl CoA via beta-oxidation of fatty acids. This will cause ketogenesis and ketoacidosis.
 
B: This choice is incorrect because high blood glucose levels in the blood mean that it is not available for use in the Krebs cycle.
C: This choice is incorrect because the Krebs cycle will be interrupted without pyruvate.
D: This choice is incorrect because glucose in the blood is not what results in higher acetyl CoA levels.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which transmembrane protein is most likely to have been involved with the repolarization after hyperpolarization of the transmembrane potential difference in Experiment 1? 
['Na+/K+ passive-transport channel',
 'Na+/K+ active-transport channel',
 'Na+/K+ ligand-gated channel',
 'None of the above']
B is correct. The Na+/K+ ion pump in neuron membranes is an active-transport channel which is responsible for causing the neuron to repolarize and become ready for the next action potential. Hence, choice B is the correct answer.
 
A: Even if an Na+/K+ passive-transport channel existed, it would only serve to help restore ion equilibrium between the inside and outside of the cell, rather than create and maintain the polarization that a -70 mV voltage difference requires.
C: There is no such thing as a Na+/K+ ligand-gated channel in neurons.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome commonly suffer from hypermobile, unstable joints and fragile, easily bruised skin. Which of these loss-of-function mutations is most likely to cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? 
['A mutation in actin',
 'A mutation in keratin',
 'A mutation in elastin',
 'A mutation in collagen']
D is correct. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome symptoms, which encompass both joints and skin, point to a problem with connective tissue. The main protein that makes up most connective tissue is collagen. Thus, a loss-of-function mutation in collagen is most likely to be the cause of EDS.
 
A: Actin is mainly found inside cells and is not a major component of connective tissue.
B: Although keratin is an intermediate filament that gives the skin its strength, it is not commonly found in joints.
C: Elastin provides elasticity to connective tissues. A loss-of-function mutation in elastin would cause the joints to be unnecessarily stiff rather than hypermobile or unstable.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In skeletal myocytes, calcium is normally released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after: 
['the muscle begins to relax.',
 'myosin releases actin.',
 'the membrane depolarizes.',
 'physical damage to the muscle occurs.']
C is correct. When a myocyte is stimulated by an action potential, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the muscle begins to contract.
 
A, B: These processes occur after calcium has been released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the muscle begins to contract.
D: This answer choice is irrelevant, though true. However, the question is asking about the normal process of muscle contraction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

From what theoretical orientations are the concepts of double bind communication and displacement respectively derived? 
['Systems theory and psychodynamic theory',
 'Cognitive behavioral theory and systems theory',
 'Humanistic theory and psychodynamic theory',
 'Systems theory and neurobehavioral theory']
A is correct. Concepts dealing with systems such as families represent systems theory. Concepts involving defenses, such as displacement, represent psychodynamic theory.

B: Cognitive behavioral theory is focused on thoughts and behaviors.

C: Humanistic theory is focused on actualization and making meaning in life, among other focuses.

D: Neurobehavioral theory connects behaviors with brain processes.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Groupthink tends to exacerbate the tendency of individuals to favor the reasoning and decisions of associates in the group. Another way of saying this is that people experiencing groupthink have a(n): 
['confirmation bias.',
 'in-group bias.',
 'self-serving bias.',
 'attribution bias.']
B is correct. The tendency to favor insiders to one's group over outsiders in evaluating arguments and decisions is known as in-group bias.

A: Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out or favor information and arguments that support positions you already hold.

C: This is the tendency for people's perceptual and cognitive processes to be distorted in order to uphold their own self-esteem.

D: Attribution bias refers to our tendency to make differing judgements about the cause of our own versus others' behavior.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The strong negative effect that losing a long-term employee can have on a hospital is most likely due to the effect on the: 
['cultural capital of the organization.',
 'group polarization of the organization.',
 'instititional memory of the organization.',
 'social facilitation of the organization.']
C is correct. Institutional memory is the collective memory of the individuals in an organization about its history, about situations the organization has confronted, and about what was necessary to deal with them. Long-term employees are valuable as they provide institutional memory for an organization, which means that the organization does not have to figure out what to do from scratch whenever an issue similar to one in the past comes up.

A: Cultural capital refers to non-financial assets that promote social mobility, such as education, knowledge of style or fashion, charisma, or appearance. It does not apply to organizations as a whole.

B: Group polarization is similar in some ways to groupthink and is the tendency for a group to come to decisions even more extreme than the initial inclination of the members. Groups inclined to risk will act more riskily, while groups inclined to caution will act more cautiously. Losing a long-term employee would have only a small impact on the inclinations of the organization. 

D: Social facilitation is the tendency for people to do better on simple tasks in the presence of other people. It means that when watched, people will do better at things that are easy or they are already good at doing. Losing one employee should not greatly affect the ability of the others to socially facilitate the quality of others' tasks.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

One of Janis' eight characteristics of groupthink is self-censorship, the withholding of opposing information by group members. It is brought on by another one of Janis's characteristics, the pressure for conformity, which encourages uniformity of opinion and characterizes deviation from the group's ideas as disloyal. This self-censorship in the face of pressure and perceived "loyalty" is most similar to: 
['deindividuation.', 'cognitive dissonance.', 'repression.', 'sublimation.']
A is correct. Deindividuation is the tendency for individuals in groups to lose self-awareness and follow along with whatever the group is doing, good or bad. Individuals engaged in groupthink tend to downplay their own ideas and adopt the group's ideas, both about what the best course of action is and what loyalty to the group entails. This loss of self in the identity of the group is most similar to deindividuation.

B: Cognitive dissonance is the tendency for people to express mental discomfort at holding two mutually contradicting beliefs. This is not relevant to the question.

C: Repression is the tendency for individuals to remove unacceptable impulses and thoughts from consciousness. There is no indication above that individuals engaging in self-censorship do not even have thoughts about opposing ideas.

D: Sublimation is a psychological defense mechanism where socially unacceptable emotions or impulses are rerouted and transformed into socially acceptable ones. This is not relevant to groupthink and self-censorship.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In order to amplify the pressure exerted on the cochlear fluid at the oval window, the oval window must be: 
['larger than the tympanic membrane.',
 'smaller than the tympanic membrane.',
 'more rigid than the tympanic membrane.',
 'less rigid than the tympanic membrane.']
B is correct. In order to increase the pressure exerted on the cochlear fluid the ossicles act to both increase the overall force exerted on the fluid as well as decrease the area over which that force is exerted (P = F/A). The area of the oval window must therefore be smaller than that of the tympanic membrane, and choice B is the correct answer.

A: A larger area relative to the tympanic membrane would decrease the pressure experienced by the cochlear fluid. 

C, D: The passage states that the oval window is a hole, not an actual structure, therefore we could not discuss it in terms of rigidity.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following bones has a footplate that acts as a piston, making contact with the cochlear fluid at the oval window? 
['Scaphoid', 'Malleus', 'Capitate', 'Stapes']
D is correct. This question requires knowledge of the three ossicle bones, the malleus, stapes and incus. The stapes is the last bone of the three, and its footplate is what drives the motion of the cochlear fluid. Choice D is therefore the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The neurotransmitter released by the inner ear hair cells is known to excite the spiral ganglion it innervates. Based on your knowledge of neurotransmitters, which of the following is most likely the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft?
['GABA', 'Acetylcholine', 'Serotonin', 'Glutamate']
D is correct. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter used in the brain, making it the most likely answer.

A, C: GABA and serotonin are inhibitory neurotransmitters and would not be likely to excite the spiral ganglion.

B: Acetylcholine does excite muscular cells, but it is not a common neurotransmitter in the brain or involved in sensory perception.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Researchers used a symptom list similar to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in order to diagnose psychiatric disorders and screen incompatible subjects from a study. When comparing data from previous studies, it was discovered that the symptoms on the most recent DSM differ from the symptoms on the previous list. Which of the following social theories best explains this discrepancy? 
['Social functionalism',
 'Social interactionism',
 'Social antipositivism',
 'Social constructionism']
D is correct. The question stem presents a scenario of an evolving list of symptoms that are deemed pathological/indicative of disease. If this list is changing, that means the behaviors/symptoms society has decided are pathological are changing as well. Social constructs are how society construct the "reality" society will use to make judgements and evaluations such as mental health diagnoses. For example, the most recent DSM has altered gender identity disorder's classification as a mental disorder. In the realm of social constructionist thought, a social construct is any idea or notion that appears to be natural and obvious to people who accept it. This sums up the researchers' use of their list to include/exclude based on mental disease.

A: This approach looks at society through a macro-level orientation, which is a broad focus on the social structures that shape society as a whole, and believes that society has evolved like organisms. This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements such as customs, traditions, and institutions.
B: In sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from human interaction. It is the study of how individuals act within society.
C: Antipositivism is the belief within social science that the social realm may not be subject to the same methods of investigation as the natural world; the social realm requires a different epistemology in which academics work beyond empiricism and the scientific method.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following parts of the ear are responsible for translating mechanical signals into an electrochemical signal? 
['Hair cells in the cochlea',
 'The stapes in the middle ear',
 'Cells of the cochlear nerve',
 'Endothelial cells in the cochlear canal']
A is correct. This question is asking us to remember the function of the ear and which part of the signal transduction is responsible for conversion of mechanical energy into an electrochemical potential. The hair cells of the organ of corti in the cochlea are responsible for responding to sound waves and releasing neurotransmitters that initiate the electrical signal transduction along the cochlear nerve. Thus choice A is correct.

B: The stapes simply converts mechanical energy into mechanical energy.
C: The cells of the cochlear nerve are nerve cells and thus are only propagators of the electrochemical signal, they do not initiate it.
D: Any endothelial cells in the cochlear canal would not be receptor cells

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In what way could college increase social stratification as an agent of socialization?
['Students of similar social class tend to group together in college',
 'College provides opportunities for students to develop contacts that will '
 'help them professionally',
 'Students in college learn behavior appropriate for successful careers',
 'College students learn about the connection between social class and college '
 'attendance']
C is correct. Agents of socialization condition individuals to behave in certain social manners. Learning professional behavior is an example of this. The rest of the answers are not examples of agents of socialization

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In addition to a drug's solubility in hydrophilic media, which of the following is likely to be an important factor in determining its oral bioavailability? 
['pKa', 'pKb', 'Solubility enhancement ratio', 'Membrane permeability']
membrane permeability

This question asks us to infer which factor is most likely to affect bioavailability, or the ability of a drug to be absorbed by the body and take effect. The passage tells us that hydrophilic solubility is important, most likely because the vast majority of biological solvents are hydrophilic. In addition, an orally-administered drug must be absorbed across the membranes of the gums, stomach, or small intestine to be effective. Therefore, membrane permeability must be important because if it is low, the drug will not cross these membranes into the bloodstream.
 
A, B: Though acidity or basicity (as represented by pKa and pKb) may have a small effect on bioavailability, they would not be nearly as important as hydrophilic solubility or membrane permeability.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A certain metabolic process in the liver produces NADH as a part of the process. If this process is up-regulated, which of the following effects associated with gluconeogenesis is most likely to follow?
['Intracellular levels of oxaloacetate will increase.',
 'Plasma glucose concentrations will increase significantly.',
 'The rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver will decrease.',
 'Plasma glucose concentrations will decrease significantly.']
C is correct. The question stem tells us that NADH levels will increase. This will decrease availability of both OAA and pyruvate, two important gluconeogenic substrates. Thus, the rate of glucose production via gluconeogenesis will decrease. 
 
A: Because pyruvate carboxylase is inhibited by increased intracellular NADH levels, the rate of conversion of pyruvate to OAA will decrease.
 
B, D: A decrease in gluconeogenesis may reduce the plasma levels of glucose somewhat, but without more information about the availability of dietary glucose or glycogen stores, neither of these choices can be concluded.

Which specific class of enzymes is primarily responsible for the release of free glycerol from stored triglycerides?
['Lipases', 'Carboxylases', 'Phosphorylases', 'Kinases']
lipases

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The conversion between glucose and pyruvate strongly favors the formation of pyruvate, and yet the gluconeogenic pathway is able to utilize several shared enzymes with glycolysis to create glucose from pyruvate. It is able to do this primarily because:
['the formation of glucose from the gluconeogenic precursors is strongly '
 'favored by the increasing entropy of the reaction.',
 'the formation of glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, and PEP push the equilibrium '
 'to favor gluconeogenesis.',
 'the activity of the enzymes with two or more functions is reversed when '
 'those enzymes are altered by kinases.',
 'enzymes in gluconeogenesis bypass reversible, equilibrium-state steps common '
 'to both pathways.']
B is correct. Production of PEP, glucose, and fructose 6-phosphate by gluconeogenesis-specific enzymes that bypass irreversible steps of glycolysis push the equilibrium of reversible enzymes that function both in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the direction of glucose production.

A: While the universe as a whole demonstrates increasing entropy, the drivers of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are reliant on changes in enthalpy through breaking and forming high-energy bonds, rather than entropic changes.

C: While some enzymes that regulate the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, such as phosphofructokinase-2 and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, are bi-functional (the nature of their action depends upon their phosphorylation state), this is not true of the enzymes of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. 

D: These steps are irreversible, not reversible, steps of glycolysis.

Three students in physics lab are given four capacitors, each with a capacitance of 4 μF, and are told to construct a circuit with the maximum possible total capacitance. Student 1 attaches all four capacitors in series. Student 2 attaches all four capacitors in parallel. Student 3 only inserts a single capacitor in his circuit. Which of the following is true?
['Student 1 and Student 3 will create circuits that have the same total '
 'capacitance.',
 'Student 2 will create the circuit with the highest capacitance.',
 'Student 2 and Student 3 will create circuits that have the same total '
 'capacitance.',
 'Student 3 will create the circuit with the highest capacitance.']
B is correct. The total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is simply the sum of their individual capacitances, so student 2 would create a circuit with 16 μF and the highest capacitance. Student 3, by only using a single capacitor, would create a circuit with 4 μF. When capacitors are connected in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is found by adding the reciprocals (like resistors in parallel), so student 1 would only create a circuit with 1 μF.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements correctly describe the methods used in the experiment? 
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
D is correct. I: Retention factor is the distance migrated by the compound divided by the total distance traveled by the solvent. TLC depends on the differential affinity of a compound for the stationary vs. the mobile phase. Therefore, depending on how polar the solvent and the adsorbent are, a compound will move on a TLC plate at a certain rate. Temperature also affects the rate of movement.
 
II: A polar compound will be attracted to the adsorbent (via dipole-dipole interactions) and, therefore, will move slower on a TLC plate, whereas a nonpolar compound will have more affinity for the mobile phase and will move faster.
 
III: The eluting strength depends on how strongly a compound adsorbs onto the adsorbent and, since typical adsorbents are highly polar, eluting strength increases with increasing solvent polarity. Methanol is more polar than pentane and therefore has a greater eluting strength.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Participant 1 rides a fourth roller coaster as shown below. What is the minimum ramp height H if the ride at the top of the loop maintains the minimum speed needed to stay on the track throughout the loop? (radius=8 m)
['10 m', '20 m', '30 m', '35 m']
B is correct. At the top of the loop, the gravitational and the normal forces (if any) point downward toward the center of the loop. Therefore, the net force causing centripetal acceleration is the sum of the gravitational force and the normal force.

When the centripetal force is the minimum amount needed for the ride to stay on track, the normal force is zero. Note: At the top, the normal force can be zero but the gravitational force cannot. Let's designate the initial height where the ride starts as H. At the very beginning, the energy of the ride is the gravitational potential energy. Therefore, Ei = mgH.
At the top of the loop, the ride includes both gravitational and potential energy. Therefore, Ef = mgH + ½ mv2 = mg (2r) + ½ mv 2. The net acceleration at top (centripetal acceleration) = v2/r. Since we concluded that the normal force at the top is zero, the net acceleration at the top is the gravitational acceleration, g. Therefore, v2 = gr. Substituting this equation into the 'Ef' equation, we obtain the following:
 
Ef = 2mgr + ½ mgr = (5/2) mgr
 
To obey conservation of energy, Ei = Ef. Therefore: mgh = (5/2) mgr. We conclude that H is 5r/2. Since r is 8 m, H is 5(8 m)/2 = 20 m.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The highly toxic cyanide anion (CN-) binds strongly to cytochrome c oxidase and prevents electron transfer. Large doses of cyanide result in: 
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
C is correct. In questions with Roman numerals (RN), start with the RN that appears in the most answer choices. Here, I and II are in 3 questions each. If we can deduce that one of these choices is incorrect, then we will already have the correct answer. Cytochrome c oxidase is an enzyme responsible for electron transfer in the electron transport chain (ETC), so inhibiting it would slow or stop the ETC. As a result, ATP production would be dramatically reduced, as the ETC is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Thus, RN II is correct. The question stem states that cyanide is highly toxic, so it makes sense that a large dose would also cause cell death (apoptosis or necrosis). Therefore, RN III is also accurate.

I: Inhibiting the ETC would reduce oxygen demand because electrons would no longer be flowing to oxygen, the final electron acceptor.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following best describes why hyperventilation would lead to a decreased blood CO2 concentration? 
['The rate of CO2 production in the cells exceeds the rate of CO2 exhalation.',
 'The rate of CO2 exhalation exceeds the rate of CO2 inhalation.',
 'The rate of CO2 exhalation exceeds the rate of CO2 production in the cells.',
 'The rate of CO2 excretion in urine exceeds the rate of CO2 in the cells.']
C is correct. The main source of CO2 in the human body is cellular production during the Krebs cycle. If an individual breathes very rapidly, he will exhale CO2 more quickly than his cells produce it. This leads to an unusually low concentration of carbon dioxide in the body, which correlates to a higher blood pH (alkalosis).

A: This would explain the opposite of the situation described in the question stem.

B: Inhalation of CO2, which has a very low concentration in air, is not a significant source of CO2 in blood.

D: This doesn't relate to exhalation or inhalation. Remember, the question stem asked about hyperventilation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following best describes how a shift to the right in the dissociation curve in Figure 1 results in more oxygen delivered to tissue? 
['The distance between the curves at 100 mmHg is less than the distance '
 'between the curves at 40 mmHg.',
 'The distance between the curves at 100 mmHg is more than the distance '
 'between the curves at 40 mmHg.',
 'On the right-shifted curve, hemoglobin will pick up more oxygen in the '
 'lungs.',
 'On the right-shifted curve, hemoglobin will pick up less oxygen in the '
 'lungs.']
A is correct. When the curve is shifted to the right, the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin at high partial pressures is less affected then it is at lower pressures. We can see this by looking at Figure 1. At a PO2 of 100 mmHg, the difference in saturation between a normal and right-shifted curve is minimal. However, at a PO2 of 40 mmHg, the difference is more profound. As a result, the amount of oxygen that each red blood cell picks up in the alveoli of the lungs is not significantly decreased, but the amount of oxygen release in the tissues increases markedly.

B: This is not a true statement; the distance between curves at 100 mmHg is less than the distance between curves at 40 mmHg.

C: Again, this is untrue. The oxygen affinity is still slightly decreased on a right-shifted curve, even at a high PO2.

D: This is a true statement, but it does not describe how oxygen can still be delivered more efficiently to the tissue.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A patient is administered a drug which mimics the effects of calcitonin's antagonist hormone. Which of the following is a likely direct effect of this drug?
['Increased buildup of hydroxyapatite crystals in long bones',
 'Decreased plasma concentrations of Ca2+',
 'Increased metabolic rate',
 'Increased osteoclast activity']
D is correct. Calcitonin decreases plasma concentrations of Ca2+ by, among other things, increasing bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity and decreasing osteoclast activity. The antagonist hormone to calcitonin is parathyroid hormone, which acts to increase plasma Ca2+ concentrations by, among other things, decreasing bone formation by osteoblasts and increasing bone degradation by osteoclasts. Thus, a drug which mimics parathyroid hormone would increase osteoclast activity.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

It has been shown that pheromones induce the body to secrete sex hormones more readily. All of the following are expected effects of sex hormones EXCEPT: 
['estrogen causes the endometrial lining to thicken.',
 'testosterone causes the Leydig cells in the seminiferous tubules to produce '
 'sperm.',
 'estrogen inhibits bone resorption.',
 'testosterone causes the development of secondary sex characteristics in '
 'boys.']
B is correct. Sperm is produced by the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules, not the Leydig cells.

A: This is true; estrogen and progesterone together cause the endometrium to thicken.

C: Estrogen does inhibit bone resorption; in fact, this is the reason why post-menopausal women experience significant declines in bone density.

D: This is also an accurate statement; testosterone causes secondary sex characteristics to develop during puberty in boys.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A particular type of bird makes its home inside the saguaro cactus by burrowing a hole in the side of the cactus. Such holes do not harm the cactus, although the cactus derives no benefit from the presence of the birds. This is an example of which of the following?
['Parasitism', 'Competition', 'Mutualism', 'Commensalism']
D is correct. This question asks us to understand the difference between different types of relationships that exist between species. When one species benefits but the other species is neither helped nor harmed, that is commensalism. That best characterizes the relationship in the question.
 
A: Parasitism benefits one species at the cost of harm to another.
 
B: Competition is when two species compete for access to a limited resource.
 
C: Mutualism requires that both species benefit

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A toxin released by a particular micro-organism binds irreversibly to calcium channels in muscle cells. This binding leaves the calcium channels open and prevents calcium from being isolated. Exposure to this toxin would result in:
['a single short muscle spasm followed by flaccid paralysis.',
 'inability of the muscle to contract.',
 'tetanic muscle contraction.',
 'transient weakness that would be compensated for within minutes.']
C is correct. High calcium concentrations allow muscle contraction to take place. Calcium binds to troponin, which causes tropomyosin to stop blocking the binding site on the thin filaments for myosin. If the calcium channels are locked open, the muscle will not be able to stop contracting. A state of constant contraction is tetany.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Following puberty, the testes begin producing large amounts of testosterone. After production, the testosterone:
['is stored in secretory granules until needed to be secreted in response to '
 'declining plasma testosterone concentrations.',
 'diffuses into the circulatory system and is transported around the body '
 'while bound to a plasma protein.',
 'is sequestered in the nucleus, where it upregulates genes associated with '
 'secondary sex characteristics in males.',
 'is transported to target tissues, where it binds to cell surface receptors '
 'and triggers a second messenger cascade.']
B is correct. Remember that testosterone is a steroid hormone. As such, it can freely diffuse through cell membranes. Also, as a hormone, testosterone is transported throughout the body in the circulatory system, not confined to the nuclei of the testes. Testoserone must bind to a transport protein since it is not hydrophilic and thus cannot simply dissolve in the blood plasma directly.
 
A, D: Both of these characteristics describe peptide hormones. Also, choice A is incorrect because testosterone (like any steroid hormone) could just diffuse through the membranes of vesicles.
 
C: As a steroid, testosterone can't be sequestered in any membrane-bound organelle.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A researcher's agar plate becomes partially contaminated with an unknown contaminant. When growing a culture of gram-negative bacteria on the plate, only the area with the contaminant is clear the next morning. The contaminant could be:
['a phage in the lytic phase.',
 'a nutrient broth lacking an essential nutrient for the gram-negative '
 'bacteria.',
 'a phage in the lysogenic phase.',
 'distilled water.']
A is correct. Whatever's contaminated the plate is killing the bacteria, preventing them from growing into the contaminated region. A virus in the lytic phase will infect and kill bacteria.
 
B: The agar itself has the necessary nutrients, since the bacteria aren't growing just where the contaminant is. Thus, adding some extra unnecessary nutrients wouldn't stop growth.
 
C: In the lysogenic phase, a virus incorporates into the bacteria and allows the bacteria to grow and reproduce.
 
D: Distilled water would likely just diffuse across the plate and is unlikely to be so toxic as to prevent all growth.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In the first trial of the PCR procedure, only one primer was added to the mixture. What was the most likely outcome during this trial? 
['Both of the DNA strands were linearly amplified.',
 'Only one strand of the DNA was exponentially amplified.',
 'Only one strand of the DNA was linearly amplified.',
 'PCR amplification was unable to proceed.']
C is correct. When performing PCR, if only one primer is added to the mixture, then that primer will bind to one of the strands and initiate replication of that strand to produce the complementary strand. For one double-stranded template DNA molecule, after one cycle, we are left with two of the complementary strand while still having only one of the strands where the primer binds. In the next cycle, the primer again binds to the strand to which it is complementary. Therefore, only the complimentary strand will be replicated again; this time we have three of the complementary strand. As you can see here, one of the strands is being replicated linearly (1 → 2 → 3 →...n), while the other strand is not replicated at all. 
 
A: Only one of the primers is added to the mixture, so one of the strands will not have a primer to be replicated.

B: The amplification is linear, not exponential (2n copies would be produced after n cycles) as explained above. 

D: PCR amplification will operate because one of the strands can still be replicated.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Defects in which of the following proteins would most likely lead to loss of structural integrity in skin epithelial cells?
['Microtubules', 'Titin', 'Intermediate filaments', 'Myosin']
C is correct. Intermediate filaments such as keratin are directly responsible for structural integrity in skin.
 
A: Microtubules are not involved in structural integrity, but in mitosis, meiosis, cell trafficking of vessels, and ciliar/flagellar motion.
 
B: Titin is a component of muscle.
 
D: Myosin is a motor protein.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In humans, the quadriceps muscle is a skeletal leg muscle under voluntary control. As such, it contracts in response to signals from the motor cortex in the cerebrum. If such a muscle contracts involuntarily, that indicates:
['a pathological hyperpolarization of the nerve innervating the muscle.',
 'an appropriate modulation of Ca2+ ions in the muscle tissue.',
 'the operation of a reflex arc.',
 'a psychological dissociative disorder.']
C is correct. Voluntary muscles may contract involuntarily due to a reflex arc. The classic example is the patellar tendon reflex, in which sudden stretching of the patellar tendon leads to an involuntary contraction of the quadriceps. Such contraction occurs before the signal has even reached the brain.
 
A: Hyperpolarization would make it harder to generate a muscle twitch, not create more muscle contraction.
 
B: If the Ca2+ ions are being appropriately modulated, the muscle would simply contract whenever it's normally supposed to - whether such contraction was voluntary or not.
 
D: Dissociative disorders are not necessarily associated with involuntary spasms or tics.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Behaviorists would assert that self-defeating behaviors are maintained by immediate reinforcement in the form of:
['relief from anxiety.',
 'defending the ego.',
 "negating one's self-image.",
 'increasing existential anxiety.']
A is correct. People are more likely to behave in a self-defeating or destructive manner either when they perceive a threat or when they have low self-esteem. These people are more likely to be susceptible to having anxiety and emotional distress, which are problems that are usually directly related to a less favorable self-appraisal. Self-defeating or self-destructive behaviors often manifest due to an inability to handle either anxiety or stress which results from a lack of self-confidence. Thus engaging in these behaviors offers an immediate relief from anxiety which then reinforces that behavior.
 
B, C, D: None of these choices reinforce self-defeating behaviors.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A psychosis arising from an advanced stage of syphilis, in which the disease attacks brain cells, is called:
["Korsakoff's syndrome.",
 'delirium tremens.',
 'schizotypal personality disorder.',
 'general paresis']
D is correct. General paresis, also known as general paralysis of the insane or paralytic dementia, is a neuropsychiatric disorder affecting the brain, caused by late-stage syphilis.

A: Korsakoff's syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the brain. Its onset is linked to chronic alcohol abuse or severe malnutrition, or both.

B: Delirium tremens is an acute episode of delirium that is usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol.

C: Schizotypal personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a need for social isolation, anxiety in social situations, odd behavior and thinking, and often unconventional beliefs.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A person with intact mirror neurons would be expected to perform similar to a person with mirror neuron dysfunction on: 
['an assessment of theory of mind.',
 'an assessment of empathy.',
 'an assessment of tactile perception.',
 "an assessment of another individual's repeated behavior."]
C is correct. Tactile perception involves perceiving information related to touch, not an activity which requires observation and understanding of others.

A: Theory of mind involves being able to take another person's perspective, an activity that would involve mirror neurons.

B: Empathy involves being able to understand another person and relate to that person's experience.

D: This assessment would involve an action very similar to what was described in the studies, which involves mirror neurons.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following theories would provide the best support to the idea that mirror neurons are involved in language acquisition?
["Chomsky's language acquisition theory",
 "Freud's drive theory",
 "Skinner's operant conditioning theory",
 "Vygotsky's social learning theory"]
D is correct. Vygotsky's social learning theory heavily stresses the role of people and interactions in language acquisition, which would involve mirror neurons.

A: According to Chomsky's view, individuals have an innate language acquisition device.

B: Drive theory contends that development is motivated by innate drives.

C: Operant conditioning contends that behavior is motivated by contingencies.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

It was discovered that in those whose stress levels are significantly elevated by traumatic events, the incidence of bedwetting was increased. During which stage of sleep is bedwetting most likely to occur? 
['1', '2', '3', 'REM']
C is correct. Typically, sleepers pass through five stages: 1, 2, 3, 4, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM, then begin again with stage 1. When a person enters stage 3 sleep, extremely slow brain waves called delta waves are interspersed with smaller, faster waves. In stage 4, the brain produces delta waves almost exclusively. During stages 3 and 4, it is very difficult to wake someone. Also, during this "deep sleep," there is no eye movement or muscle activity. This is when some children experience bedwetting, sleepwalking, or night terrors.

A: Stage 1 represents light sleep, where one drifts in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. In this stage, the eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows.

B: In stage 2 sleep, eye movement stops and brain waves become slower, with only an occasional burst of rapid brain waves called sleep spindles.

D: During REM sleep, breathing becomes more rapid, irregular and shallow; eyes jerk rapidly, and limb muscles are temporarily paralyzed. Brain waves during this stage increase to levels experienced when a person is awake. Also, heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and the body loses some of the ability to regulate temperature.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A research subject is shown the following list of the following words: wing, engine, tail, and window. When later presented with and asked to recall whether the presented word was on the original list, the participant identifies "runway" as having been on the list. This is an example of:
['the context effect.', 'a miss.', 'a false alarm.', 'déjà vu.']
C is correct. The subject is primed with airplane-related words, then incorrectly identifies another airplane-related word as having been a part of the list. This is a false alarm because the participant incorrectly responds positively when the stimulus was in fact not present.

A: Context effects refer to increased recall when the subject is in a similar environment as the one in which the original learning took place.

B: A "miss" implies that the stimulus was indeed present on the list, but the participant did not recognize it.

D: Déjà vu is an example of a context effect in which a person believes he has experienced an event before.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If a group of individuals diagnosed with personality disorder were found to believe that their socially destructive actions should have yielded neutral or positive social results with those around them, it would best support which personality theory?
['Humanistic perspective',
 'Social cognitive perspective',
 'Behaviorist perspective',
 'Biological perspective']
B is correct. The correct answer must explain the behavior of the subjects in terms of their expectations of others. The social cognitive perspective is based upon expectations of others.

A: The humanistic perspective is centered on the use of free will and how to best apply it, which would not apply in this case.

C: The behaviorist perspective is related to external stimuli experienced by the person. Since this question stem focuses on the predicted experiences of others, this does not apply here.

D: The biological perspective is based on biological inheritance, which is irrelevant to this scenario.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Zoologists discover a new species of lizard with a low degree of sexual dimorphism. Which of the following behaviors would the researchers most expect to find exhibited by members of this species?
['Repetitive mating between monogamous pairs of lizards',
 'Helping by juvenile relatives of lizards with young offspring',
 'More complex courtship rituals than other, similar species',
 'Males building large, ornate nests to attract females']
A is correct. Sexual dimorphism refers to the degree to which males and females resemble each other. A species with low sexual dimorphism contains males and females that look mostly identical. High sexual dimorphism signals intense competition for mates, while animals from species with low sexual dimorphism typically form pair bonds and mate for life.

B: Alloparenting, or caretaking of offspring by individuals other than the biological parents, is not related to dimorphism. 

C, D: These are traits that one would expect from a species with intense mate competition.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Stimulus motives are:
['needs that are learned, such as the need for power or for achievement.',
 'innate but not necessary for survival.',
 'not innate but necessary for survival.',
 'innate and necessary for survival.']
B is correct. A stimulus motive is defined as a motive that appears to be unlearned but causes an increase in stimulation, such as curiosity. These motives are not necessary for survival.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A student just began her first month of medical school and is seeing a patient with two third-year students. When the attending physician asks her opinion on the diagnosis, she states that she agrees with what the older students already said. Which of the following best describes the most likely reason for her response? 
['Informative pressure',
 'Normative pressure',
 'Conformity pressure',
 'Groupthink']
A is correct. Informative pressure is a subtype of conformity pressure. It occurs when an individual conforms his or her behavior to match that of the rest of a group out of the belief that the group is better informed and knows more than the individual. The medical student most likely believes that because she has only been in medical school a few weeks, the third-year students know more than she does.
 
B: Normative pressure is a subtype of conformity pressure in which the individual knows that the others are incorrect, but still feels pressure to not dissent from the rest of the group. Since this pressure does not arise out of a belief that others know more, it is less likely than choice A based on this situation.

C: The situation described is a type of conformity pressure, but option A is more specific. The question asks which of the following "best describes" the scenario.

D: Groupthink refers to decision-making becoming more irrational or dysfunctional as a group increases in size. This does not accurately describe the situation above.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Some studies of depressed and non-depressed individuals show that both populations can have similar physiological reactions to an emotion-provoking stimulus, but that depressed patients are more likely to contexualize the stimulus in a harmful way. This suggests that depressed patients experience an emotional imbalance based on which theory of emotion?
['Schachter-Singer', 'James-Lange', 'Locke-Adams', 'Cannon-Bard']
A is correct. The Schacter-Singer theory posits that emotions are based on a physiological stimulus which the mind then puts into a particular context. Processing the context of the stimulus creates the emotion experienced.

B: The James-Lange theory posits that emotions are solely the result of autonomic arousal causing the particular emotion experienced.

D: The Cannon-Bard theory asserts that the physiological arousal and subjective experience occur simultaneously and independently as a result of subcortical brain activity.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the evolutionary explanation for why the limbic system developed early in mammals in the triune brain?
['The limbic system controls executive processes that are essential for '
 'survival.',
 'Brains develop from the outside inwards, so the limbic system develops '
 'first.',
 'The limbic system regulates emotions, which help guide behavior.',
 'The limbic system is little used later in life.']
C is correct. Emotions play a critical role in survival, such as by perceiving threats and registering fear.

A: The limbic system is not involved in executive processes.

B: The brain develops from the inside outwards.

D: The limbic system (as well as all areas of the brain) is used throughout life.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT an aspect of groupthink that contributes to mob violence?
['Feeling that all members will act similarly',
 'Feelings of invincibility in the mob',
 'Feeling that the mob is right',
 'Viewing outgroups as similar and thus necessitating violence to separate']
D is correct. When groupthink is present, members view outgroups as different.

A: Feelings of unanimity are present in groupthink.

B: Group members often feel invincible.

C: Group members often feel a sense of self-righteousness.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following are reasons for the development of intersectionality from feminism?
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II only', 'I, II, and III']
C is correct. Statements I and II are true. Intersectionality is concerned with the intersection of different identities and how this unique combination influences people. Logically, this would naturally arise in response to feminism not accounting for the effects of the combination of multiple cultural identities.

III: This is false; feminism is very focused on the influence of systems on individuals and vice versa.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the most likely formula for the ingredient shown on the label in Figure 1, called dibasic calcium phosphate? 
['CaPO4', 'Ca3(PO4)2', 'CaHPO4', 'Ca(H2PO4)2']
C is correct. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4, and all three of its hydrogen atoms are acidic. As a result, there are three associated anions (PO43-, HPO42-, and H2PO4-), which are typically named phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and dihydrogen phosphate, respectively. Alternatively, we can refer to these anions in terms of their ability to act as Brønsted-Lowry bases. For example, PO43- has the ability to gain three protons, so it can be called tribasic phosphate. Calcium ion is Ca2+, and when combined with the dibasic anion, HPO42-, the resulting formula is that in choice C. 

A: Since calcium ion has a +2 charge while phosphate carries a -3 charge, this formula does not make sense. 

B: PO43- is the tribasic, not the dibasic, ion. 

D: The anion in this choice is the monobasic ion.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following potential ingredients in a multivitamin and mineral supplement would be least soluble in aqueous solution? 
['Potassium chloride', 'Ferrous sulfate', 'Sodium selenate', 'Aluminium oxide']
D is correct. Like the vast majority of ionic compounds with Group 1 cations, potassium chloride and sodium selenate are soluble in aqueous solution. This eliminates choices A and C. Most ionic sulfate compounds are soluble, with a couple of exceptions, including PbSO4, CaSO4, BaSO4 and SrSO4. Since ferrous sulfate is not one of these exceptions, it is soluble in aqueous solution and choice B can be eliminated. Most oxides are insoluble, except when the cation is a group 1 ion. Aluminum oxide is very insoluble in aqueous solution.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A scientist uses an ultrasound device to measure fluid flow underground. The device makes use of the doppler effect to track fluid movement in the water table. If the speed of sound in the ground is known and the scientist measures the frequency of the returning wave, what additional information is required to calculate the speed of the flowing water?
['The frequency of the emitted wave',
 'The wavelength of the returning wave',
 'The speed of sound in air',
 'No additional information is required']
A is correct. The Doppler equation uses the speed of sound, the speed of the object, and the frequencies of the emitted and returning wave. Here, the scientist wishes to calculate the speed of the water. Thus, she must know the speed of sound (given in the question), the frequency of the returning wave (given in the question), and the frequency of the emitted wave (choice A).

B: The Doppler equation includes frequency, not wavelength.

C: The sound is not traveling through air, so this is irrelevant.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The azimuthal quantum number corresponds with which of the following?
['The potential energy of the electron',
 'Approximate radial size of an electron cloud',
 'Approximate geometric shape of the orbital',
 'Number of valence electrons orbiting a nucleus']
C is correct. The azimuthal quantum number for an atomic orbital determines its orbital angular momentum and describes the shape of the orbital.
 
A, B: This value is quantified by the principal quantum number, n.
 
D: This value is not quantified by any quantum number. The number of valence electrons orbiting a nucleus can only be obtained by examining the complete spectroscopic notation of the electron or the location of the atom on the periodic table.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Presbyopia is diagnosed when the lens of the eye focuses incoming light rays to a position between the retina and the choroid. Which type of lens should be placed in front of the eye to focus light on the retina and correct this condition?
['Flat', 'Spherical', 'Diverging', 'Converging']
D is correct. The problem with presbyopia (far-sightedness) is the image is formed behind the retina rather than on the retina. A converging lens will converge light rays before they can pass the retina and focus light closer to the retina.
 
A: A flat lens will not cause the light rays to converge any sooner and will not correct presbyopia.
 
B: A spherical lens can be diverging or converging and may not cause the light rays to converge any sooner; in that case, it would not correct presbyopia.
 
C: A diverging lens would spread out the light before it reaches the retina and will further exacerbate the problem. It will not correct presbyopia

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following solvents would lead to the fastest SN1 reaction?
['n-hexane', 'Benzene', 'Tetrachloromethane', 'Propanol']
D is correct. SN1 reactions proceed faster in protic solvents. SN2 reactions prefer polar aprotic solvents. The only protic solvent here is choice D.
 
A, B, C: These are all nonpolar solvents. Note that another name for C is carbon tetrachloride.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Channel A transports only the smallest solutes dissolved in the intracellular fluid through the axon membrane. Which of the following is most likely transported by channel A?
['Albumin', 'Oxygen', 'Potassium ions', 'Chloride ions']
C is correct. Of all of the species listed, potassium ions will be the smallest and thus, carried by channel A. Of particular note, Cl- and K+ have the same electron configuaration. Of those two, the potassium ion has more protons and will attract the electrons more tightly than the chloride ion.

A: Albumin, a plasma protein, is larger than any ion.

B: Oxygen molecules (O2) are larger than potassium ions.

D: Chloride ions are larger than potassium ions.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A bacterium has a faulty lac operon in which there is a structural defect in the operator. In this bacterium:
['there is a mutation in a segment of DNA that binds a promoter.',
 'a missense mutation is found in the gene that codes for the repressor.',
 'there is a structural problem with a segment of DNA that binds a repressor.',
 'there will be no proteins available capable of digesting lactose.']
C is correct. In the lac operon, the operator is the segment of DNA that binds to the repressor. In the absense of functional repressor/operator binding, the cell will constitutively produce the proteins needed for lactose metabolism. Although this may not be fatal to the cell, it will waste energy if the surroundings lack lactose.

A: The promoter is a segment of DNA. It binds to RNA polymerase.

B: The operator binds to the repressor. The repressor is coded elsewhere. 

D: This is false; without functional operator/repressor binding, the cell's lactose-digesting machinery will be "stuck on."

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A particular oncogene product has an unusually high number of proline residues. These residues:
['aid in the formation of alpha helices.',
 'are more likely to be found throughout beta-pleated sheets.',
 'aid only in the formation of antiparallel beta-pleated sheets.',
 'are more likely to be found in turn regions of the protein.']
D is correct. The unusual cyclic structure of proline creates a high degree of rigidity in the primary structure of a protein and disrupts the normal formation of alpha or beta secondary structures. Thus proline is much more likely to be found in the unstructured "turn" regions of a protein between the larger secondary structures

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Methanol poisoning occurs when the body converts a large amount of methanol to harmful chemicals that attack the optic nerves, leading to acute blindness. Ethanol is the antidote for methanol poisoning because ethanol is preferentially processed by the body. Ethanol is most likely to be a(n): 
['allosteric inhibitor.',
 'competitive inhibitor.',
 'noncompetitive inhibitor.',
 'irreversible inhibitor.']
B is correct. Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme in question, blocking the substrate from attaching. The question stem states that ethanol is "preferentially processed," or processed by one or more enzymes instead of methanol. Thus, it is highly likely that ethanol binds to the active site where methanol otherwise would, making it a competitive inhibitor.

B, C: These forms of inhibition do not involve binding to the active site. As a result, they do not explain why ethanol is "preferentially processed," or reacted with in the place of methanol.

D: Irreversible inhibition occurs when the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme in a way that chemically alters it. There is no evidence that this occurs here.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An enzyme inhibited by competitive inhibitors would, compared to its uninhibited state, display a: 
['lower Km and the same Vmax.',
 'lower Km and lower Vmax.',
 'higher Km and the same Vmax.',
 'higher Km and lower Vmax.']
C is correct. Competitive inhibitors are those which "compete" with the substrate for binding at the active site. Since both inhibitor and substrate attach at the same position, the addition of sufficient quantities of substrate can overcome the inhibitor and allow the reaction to reach its original maximum rate. For this reason, the maximal rate of the reaction (Vmax) does not change.

However, competitive inhibitors do change the Km, or the concentration of substrate required to reach one-half of Vmax. Since extra substrate must be added to overcome the inhibitor, competitive inhibition results in an increase in Km.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following segments of amino acids would be most likely to be found in the membrane-spanning domain of the sodium channel in a nerve axon?
['DDR', 'EVE', 'LAD', 'LIV']
D is correct. The inside of the membrane is hydrophobic, so the membrane-spanning domain of a protein will likely consist of more hydrophobic amino acid residues. Only choice D consists of three amino acids all of which have hydrophobic side chains: leucine, isoleucine, and valine all have hydrocarbon R groups as side chains.
 
A, B, C: Each of these choices have charged side-chains (D, E: negative; R: positive) that would not favor the hydrophobic region inside a membrane.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Women over 35 years of age have an increased risk of nondisjunction due to errors in what phase of meiosis?
['Prophase I', 'Metaphase I', 'Anaphase II', 'Prophase II']
C is correct. Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during anaphase I of meiosis or the failure of sister chromatids to separate properly during anaphase II of meiosis.
 
A, B, D: Nondisjunction will not occur in any of these phases.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Each of the following structures are derived from the mesoderm EXCEPT:
['Kidneys', 'Spinal cord', 'Triceps', 'Circulatory system']
B is correct. The mesoderm gives rise to the musculo-skeletal system, circulatory system, and kidneys. Choice B, the spinal cord, is derived from ectoderm.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

During oxidative phosphorylation, which membrane complex transfers electrons from succinate to coenzyme Q?
['Complex I', 'Complex II', 'Complex III', 'Complex IV']
B is correct. Complex II, like complex I, transfers electrons to coenzyme Q. Complex I receives its electrons from NADH, while complex II receives electrons from succinate.
 
A: Complex I transfers electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q.

C: Complex III transfers electrons from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c.

D: Complex IV transfers electrons from cytochrome c to the final electron acceptor, oxygen.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Mead's social theory presents the part of the self which is called the "me" as the:
['autonomous sense of self that reacts to the attitudes taken in from society.',
 "part of the self that generates moral behavior and is critical of the self's "
 'thoughts and actions.',
 'collection of attitudes taken from society.',
 'organized, realistic part of the self that mediates between base desires and '
 'moral impulses.']
C is correct. In Mead's theory of the nature of the self, people are divided into the "I" and the "me." The "me" is the collection of attitudes taken from society, whereas the "I" is the autonomous sense of self that reacts to the "me."

A: This is a description of Mead's idea of the "I."

B: This describes a Freudian idea, the super-ego.

D: The ego, which (according to Freud) mediates between the id and the super-ego, matches this choice, not the "me."

 -------------------------------------------------- 

One explanation for the development of personality uses the biological perspective, which emphasizes the influence of genetics and brain biology in determining an individual's behavioral, emotional, and cognitive patterns. Which of the following psychologists' views are most closely aligned with this perspective? 
['Abraham Maslow', 'Hans Eysenck', 'B.F. Skinner', 'Gordon Allport']
B is correct. Hans Eysenck is noted for the first empirical study he published on genetics of personality in 1951, which investigated the trait of neuroticism in identical (i.e., monozygotic) and fraternal (i.e., dizygotic twins).

A: Abraham Maslow is better known for his involvement with the humanistic perspective of personality, where he formed the hierarchy of needs to describe the physiological and psychological needs humans require to be fulfilled.

C: B.F. Skinner is more closely related to the behaviorist perspective of personality, where he studied the ability of operant conditioning to modify personality over time.

D: Gordon Allport is known in connection to the trait perspective of personality. He argued that three key types of traits contribute to personality: cardinal traits, central traits, and secondary traits.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In addition to the amygdala and hippocampus mentioned in the passage, which part of the brain contributes to the "limbic system?" 
['Occipital lobe', 'Cerebellum', 'Hypothalamus', 'Frontal lobe']
C is correct. While there is no universal agreement on the total list of structures that comprise the limbic system, the main brain regions that are recognized to constitute the core limbic system are the amygdala, hippocampus, limbic cortex, septal area, and hypothalamus.

A: This is not considered part of the limbic system; it is more involved in vision.

B: The cerebellum, which plays a role in the coordination and regulation of muscular activity, is not part of the limbic system.

D: The frontal lobe is involved in reward behavior, inhibition, planning, motivation, and attention, but it is not part of the limbic system.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Projection and rationalization serve as ego defense mechanisms in those affected by BPD. In which portions of the mind would Sigmund Freud argue that the ego functions in these individuals?
['I only', 'I and II', 'I and III', 'I, II, and III']
D is correct. Sigmund Freud defined the ego as the principle which drives to please the id in realistic ways that will provide benefit (and reduce grief) in the long term. It has the capacity to act through the conscious mind (i.e., awareness at the present moment), the unconscious mind (i.e., processes that occur automatically in the mind and are not available to introspection), and the preconscious mind (i.e., thoughts in the minds that are unconscious but can be recalled if necessary).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Some people believe that school success should be based on hard work, but in actuality there are a number of extraneous factors that contribute to student success. These are examples of: 
['inductive meritocracy and deductive meritocracy, respectively.',
 'deductive meritocracy and inductive meritocracy, respectively.',
 'prescriptive meritocracy and descriptive meritocracy, respectively.',
 'descriptive meritocracy and prescriptive meritocracy, respectively.']
C is correct. In sociology, prescriptive refers to what an individual believes should occur, while descriptive refers to what one perceives as actually occurring.

A, B: Inductive reasoning extrapolates from individual observations to general principles, while deductive reasoning is the opposite. Neither of these phenomena is occurring in the situations described by the question stem.

D: This answer has the reasoning reversed. .

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Throughout much of its recent existence, Indonesia has had a very strong economy with sharply defined and well-functioning political structures. Its economy and military were some of the strongest in the region, while neighboring Papua New Guinea had much weaker systems and was almost wholly dependent on Indonesia for trade and protection. Indonesia could be described as:
['an undeveloped nation.',
 'a semi-periphery nation.',
 'a core nation.',
 'a periphery nation']
C is correct. In World Systems Theory, nations are split into core, semi-periphery, and periphery countries on the basis of their wealth, military strength, and government institutions. Core countries are those well-developed, wealthy capitalist nations that control many resources, have powerful militaries, and strong state institutions. This description matches the description of Indonesia in the question.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Mr. Smith believes his son John smokes marijuana because he looks very similar to "typical stoners" that Mr. Smith has seen. John sometimes smells a little funny and has been dressing differently because he has started practicing yoga - he has to wear loose clothes at the studio and he smells because his teacher burns incense in class. What cognitive heuristic did Mr. Smith use when judging John?
['Adjustment heuristic',
 'Anchoring heuristic',
 'Availability heuristic',
 'Representativeness heuristic']
D is correct. Mr. Smith believed his son's look (and smell) was similar to a category of people (typical teens who smoke marijuana) and inferred that he had all of the attributes of a person who smokes.
 
A, B: Anchoring and adjustment heuristics are the same thing - they mean that we tie impressions to earlier perceptions of people. In this example, Mr. Smith would make a judgment about John's behavior based on what he already knew about him.
C: The availability heuristic states that whatever comes to mind first is what we believe to be common and prevalent. This isn't really the best option here

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The results of the experiments with HM suggest that the hippocampus is responsible for what function?
['Long-term memory', 'Short-term memory', 'Working memory', 'Eidetic memory']
A is correct. After HM had his hippocampus removed, he was urable to remember information for longer than he was able to hold it in his immediate memory. Thus, it supports the idea that the hippocampus is responsible for long-term memory.

B, C: Short-term and working memory are both involved when HM rehearses the information and is able to recall it.

D: Eidetic memory is commonly known as photographic memory and is not a skill HM ever had.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A sociologist is evaluating the interactions between clients and personal injury attorneys. She examines relations between rich, successful, white attorneys and clients who are poor and from immigrant families. The sociologist seeks to focus her analysis on the difficulties that arise as a result of the differing levels of wealth and status possessed by the attorneys and clients. This analysis could best be described by which sociological framework?
['Symbolic interactionism',
 'Functionalism',
 'Conflict theory',
 'Norm-deviance dynamics']
C is correct. Conflict theory analyzes social interactions in terms of the conflict between the powerful and powerless, high and low status, and rich and poor. Since the sociologist is comparing the experiences of high- and low-status individuals, conflict theory is the best framework for her studies.

A: Symbolic interactionism studies how people interact by using shared understanding of certain symbols (e.g. a "thumbs up" sign).

B: Functionalism analyzes society as a working set of interdependent parts, rather than focusing on conflicts between different social classes.

D: This does not refer to a sociological framework and is purely a distractor.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Sociologists have found that for first-generation immigrants from West African nations, health outcomes and healthcare disparities are relatively minor compared to white and Asian populations, whereas the children of West African immigrants experience health outcomes and healthcare disparities nearly aligned with US-born African American populations. This sharp downward change in a single generation is likely:
['a negative consequence of social segregation into ethnic enclaves.',
 'due to lifelong exposure to higher socioeconomic environment of the US as '
 'compared to West African nations.',
 'unrelated to educational attainment.',
 'due to increased social and cultural integration in the US.']
D is correct. Children who are born in the US tend to show outcomes that are similar to other US-born people in the same demographic group. This demonstrates that the second-generation immigrant children have socially integrated more fully into the US culture.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements, if true, LEAST accords with social construction theory?
['The inclusion of many social-networking features in the typical smart phone '
 'is a result of the value systems of those who designed it.',
 'An art film containing several scenes depicting explicit sexual activity is '
 'marginalized because no "good" member of a society is willing to view it.',
 'World War II is seen by most Americans over the age of 50 as "the last good '
 'war" in which the US was unequivocally on the side of justice.',
 'The high value of the automobile in enabling personal autonomy is universal '
 'across widely disparate societies.']
D is correct. Social construction theory views human activity as consisting of human creations made through countless individual human choices and through interactions, primarily mediated through language. The theory does not hold that things exist in a universal sense outside of their historical context. Here, choice D would be LEAST consistent with social constructionism because it suggests that the value of the automobile is a universal.
 
A, B, C: These are all more consistent with social construction theory as they represent cases in which technology, art, and history are all understood in a way that is constructed by a particular culture or subculture.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If the researchers have participants participate in each group in the study, what type of research design has been introduced?
['A field experiment',
 'A cross-sectional design',
 'A longitudinal design',
 'A crossover design']
D is correct. A crossover design occurs when participants participate in each group in a study.

A: A field experiment occurs in natural conditions.

B: A cross-sectional design involves the measurement of a group of people at a particular time, as opposed to over a longer time interval (as in a longitudinal study).

C: A longitudinal design occurs over a period of time.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Steve is instructed by his boss to forge a document. Steve knows that it is against company policy and possibly against the law, but he is afraid he may lose his job if he doesn't comply. Under Kohlberg's stages of moral development, what stage is Steve in if he decides to forge the document?
['Preoperational',
 'Preconventional',
 'Postconventional',
 'Concrete operational']
B is correct. The preconventional stage in Kohlberg's stages of moral development is characterized by more concern for rewards and punishments than social rules and laws.

A, D: Preoperational and concrete operational are actually two of Piaget's stages of cognitive development.

C. The postconventional stage in Kohlberg's stages of moral development is characterized by concern for morality and the good of society, rather than social rules and laws.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In which of the following societies would anomie most likely be observed?
['A high school with a science and technology focus in which students who '
 'graduate are far more likely than average high school students to believe '
 'that arts funding is a waste of public money',
 'A college campus on which students are required to make such extensive use '
 'of technology that the level of normal face-to-face interaction drops '
 'precipitously below the norm at other college campuses',
 'A large corporate campus for a multi-national food additive company in which '
 'upper management actively promotes certain political views and candidates',
 'A committee of military generals with high group cohesiveness that '
 'over-estimates its own ability to make military planning decisions and is '
 'unwilling to consider dissent']
B is correct. Anomie is the notion that there is a breakdown between individuals and cultural norms, leading to a widespread sense of alienation between individuals and their society. Choice B describes one example of this situation in which normal social interaction is well below normal levels.
 
A, C: These relate to attitudes that members of society have, rather than the feeling of disconnection and breakdown of society.
D: This is a good example of groupthink, not anomie.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In general, chronic consumption of trans fats are considered to induce more negative cardiovascular outcomes in humans than chronic consumption of comparable cis fats. Which of the following statements provides a reasonable hypothesis as to why this might be the case?
['The hydrocarbon tails of trans fats experience less London dispersion '
 'forces, as compared to those of comparable cis fats, making them more likely '
 'to be solids at body temperature and cause obstruction in blood vessels.',
 'Trans fats are more easily solubilised by bile acids in the small intestine '
 'than comparable cis fats, making them more likely to be absorbed by the '
 'circulatory system and cause obstruction in blood vessels.',
 'The hydrocarbon tails of trans fats experience less electrostatic repulsion '
 'when in close proximity to one another, as compared to those of comparable '
 'cis fats, making them more likely to be solids at body temperature and cause '
 'obstruction in blood vessels.',
 'Trans fats are more easily solubilised by chylomicrons and absorbed by the '
 'microvilli of the small intestine than comparable cis fats, making them more '
 'likely to be absorbed by the circulatory system and cause obstruction in '
 'blood vessels.']
C is correct. Both the question and the answer choices are rather wordy, making process of elimination our best bet. Answer choice (A) seems to make sense on the surface; however, London dispersion forces rely (as far as the MCAT is concerned) far more on molecular mass than molecular structure. The difference in structure isn't really significant here, so we'll table this one and search for something better.
Answer choice (B) is way off base; the solubilisation of fats by bile acids is FAR more dependent on size than structure. Answer choice (C) however makes more sense; trans fats "slot" together more effectively than cis fats would, reducing electrostatic repulsion overall. Answer choice (D), similarly to (B) is pretty far from the mark; chylomicrons, like bile acids, operate mostly on size and are completely structure-blind. When left with choices (C) and (A), we can reasonably conclude that the minor difference in structure here has a far greater effect on electrostatic repulsion than London dispersion forces. Choice (C) is therefore the best answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is most likely to undergo positive beta decay? 
['14C', '13C', '17O', '22Na']
D is correct. This question requires us to think about why 18F is a good candidate for positive beta decay. The reason is that it has one fewer neutron than typical fluorine, giving it a higher proton/neutron ratio. Positron emission occurs when the proton/neutron ratio is too high. Thus, we are looking for something that has a lower atomic mass than usual, as does choice D.
 
A, B, C: All of these have a higher-than-normal atomic mass.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What will be the difference in hematocrit between a person living at a higher elevation and a person living at a lower elevation?
['The person living at a higher elevation will have the higher hematocrit '
 'because of the decreased atmospheric pressure.',
 'The person living at a higher elevation will have the higher hematocrit '
 'because there is less oxygen in the air.',
 'The person living at a lower elevation will have the higher hematocrit '
 'because of the higher atmospheric pressure.',
 'The person living at a lower elevation will have the higher hematocrit '
 'because there is more oxygen in the air.']
B is correct. A person living at a higher elevation will produce more blood cells because there is less oxygen in the air. The kidney has receptors that read the oxygen levels in our blood and produce erythropoietin in order to produce more blood cells. This will increase the hematocrit. So choice B is correct. 
 
A, C: These are not correct because the change in atmospheric pressure is not what would directly effect a person's hematocrit.
D: This is not correct because at a lower elevation there is more oxygen than at a higher elevatio

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If a protein is at a pH below its isoelectric point, which of the following is true? 
['The protein will have a net positive charge.',
 'The protein will have a net negative charge.',
 'The protein will have net charge of zero.',
 'The protein does not contain charged side groups.']
A is correct. This question is asking us to determine the state of a protein at a pH below its isoelectric point. We can see from Figure 1 that at a pH below its pI, the protein will have to move toward the right, toward the cathode. Since the cathode is negative, this means the protein will be positive; thus, choice A is correct.
 
B, C: The protein will have a positive net charge.
D: The protein may or may not have charged side groups, but this is irrelevant.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

All of the following are functions performed by macrophages EXCEPT: 
['antigen presentation.', 'opsonization.', 'phagocytosis.', 'cytokine release.']
B is correct. Opsonization is the process by which antibodies bind to and recognize antigens on the surface of a pathogen. The antibodies then attract macrophages to phagocytose the invader. 

A, C, D: These are all functions of macrophages.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Where in a eukaryotic cell would you be most likely to find the highest concentration of lipid peroxides? 
['Cell membrane',
 'Nuclear membrane',
 'Inner mitochondrial membrane',
 'Golgi apparatus']
C is correct. Lipid peroxides are formed by free-radical attack on a lipid. Thus, we expect the location with the most lipid peroxidation to be someplace where oxygen is participating in a redox reaction. As it so happens, the electron transport chain which is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane has oxygen as its terminal electron acceptor. The electron transport chain can "leak," producing free radicals such as superoxide that react with nearby lipids to make lipid peroxides.

A, B, D: Although the cell membrane, nuclear membrane and the membranes of the Golgi apparatus all have many protein transporters and signaling proteins, there majority of reactions occurring here don't involve oxygen, so they are unlikely to produce a lot of lipid peroxidation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

How many substituents within the ETC are capable of carrying more than two electron at a time? 
['0', '1', '2', '3']
A is correct. There are 5 electron carriers involved in the ETC; NADH-Q reductase, ubiquinone, cytochrome reductase, cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase. Each carrier in the electron transport chain is only capable of carrying one or two electrons at a time.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A child presents to a medical student with swollen cervical lymph nodes and a fever. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 
['Lymphatic obstruction',
 'Leukemia',
 'Staphylococcal infection',
 'Breast cancer']
C is correct. This question is best tackled by process of elimination: 

A: The job of the lymph system is to exchange fluids between the tissues and circulatory system. Lymphatic obstruction would not lead swelling of the lymph nodes themselves, but would cause noticeable swelling of the tissue supplied by those lymph nodes. The obstruction would also fail to explain the fever, a typical sign of infection by a foreign pathogen. 
B: Leukemia could cause swollen lymph nodes and can present with a fever, but is less likely to do so than infection.
D: Breast cancer is common in adults, but is unheard of in children. This is because breast tissue doesn't develop until puberty under the influence of hormones, and it takes many years for a premalignant lesion to pick up the mutations necessary for it to become cancer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At excess levels, which of the following could serve as an activator of the TCA enzyme citrate synthase? 
['ADP', 'Citrate', 'Succinyl-CoA', 'NADH']
A is correct. TCA is another name for the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle. Increased concentration of ADP signals that more ATP is needed. Therefore, the citric acid cycle enzyme will be activated by the presence of ADP. 
 
B: Citrate is the product of the enzyme citrate synthase. Through negative feedback, citrate accumulation would inhibit further citrate production. 
C: Succinyl-CoA is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Excess accumulation of cycle intermediates would serve as a signal that enough citric acid cycles have been run. Excess succinyl-CoA would most likely inhibit the cycle. 
D: NADH is a product of the citric acid cycle. Therefore, its production would act to inhibit the cycle.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Fluid pressure changes with depth are assumed to be linear. Which statement best explains why this does not hold true for atmospheric pressure changes? 
['At very high temperatures, air behaves less ideally.',
 'The volume of a mass of air is not constant.',
 'The majority of molecules in air are nonpolar.',
 'Air is not of a uniform composition.']
B is correct. Hydrostatic pressure for liquids is linear because as depth changes, the density of the liquid remains constant. Gases, however, have densities that change according to the forces applied to them. Gases are compressible, while liquids and solids are not.

A: For gases, higher temperatures result in behavior that is more ideal. 

C: This is true, but does not explain the non-linear behavior.

D: The kinetic molecular theory of gases states that gaseous mixtures do not act differently from pure gases, nor would this explain non-linear behavior.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In the electron transport chain, which of the following is the component that is reduced but never oxidized?
['Ubiquinone', 'Oxygen', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'ADP']
B is correct. This question is testing your knowledge of the electron transport chain. Almost all elements in the chain are at some point reduced and oxidized. This is the driving force behind the electron transport chain. However, at the end of the chain, oxygen is reduced to form H2O, which is the end fate of the electrons in the chain.

A: Ubiquinone accepts electrons, then passes them off. Therefore, it is both reduced and oxidized.

C: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide refers to NAD+/NADH. This compound is reduced to form NADH and oxidized back to NAD+ after transferring an electron to Complex I of the electron transport chain.

D: ADP is oxidized to ATP.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Cefixime displays what inhibitive behavior on PBP? 
['Competitive inhibition',
 'Non-competitive inhibition',
 'Uncompetitive inhibition',
 'Suicide inhibition']
D is correct. According to the passage, cephalosporins bind irreversibly to the active site of PBP. Of the inhibitor types given as answer choices, only a suicide inhibitor acts as an irreversible enzyme inhibitor. Suicide inhibition occurs when an enzyme binds the inhibitor (structurally a substrate analogue) and forms an irreversible complex with it, usually through a covalent bond. This can involve the inhibitor being chemically modified by the enzyme during the normal course of catalysis to produce a reactive group that is specifically responsible for the formation of the irreversible inhibitor-enzyme complex.

A, B, C: Each of these inhibitor types works through a reversible inhibition mechanism.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Air is bubbled through distilled water. The solution will have a pH:
['greater than 7 because elemental nitrogen undergoes hydrolysis.',
 'less than 7 because elemental nitrogen undergoes hydrolysis.',
 'greater than 7 because carbon dioxide undergoes hydrolysis.',
 'less than 7 because carbon dioxide undergoes hydrolysis.']
D is correct. Air contains elemental nitrogen as its major component, but elemental nitrogen is essentially inert and is neither an acid nor a base. On the other hand, carbon dioxide can undergo a hydrolysis reaction in liquid water to produce carbonic acid, a weak acid that produces a solution whose pH is less than the pH of water (pH = 7).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the approximate pH of a saturated aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid whose molarity is 10.6 M?
['-1', '1', '7', '13']
A is correct. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and completely dissociates in aqueous solution. In this solution, the hydronium ion concentration is 10.6 M, which can be approximated as 10 M to make the math easier. The pH is the -log of the hydronium ion concentration: -log[10] = -log[101] = -1. While the typical pH range is normally thought of as ranging from 0 to 14, if the concentration of hydronium ion is greater than 1 M, negative pH values are possible. It is also possible to have pH values greater than 14, i.e. if the hydroxide concentration is greater than 1 M.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When a patient is on the operating table for heart surgery, surgeons need to clamp major nearby blood vessels before cutting them because, according to Bernoulli's equation, a volume of pressurized blood opened to the atmosphere: 
['will convert its pressure to kinetic energy, rapidly exiting the body and '
 'causing shock.',
 'will convert its pressure to potential energy, pooling at the high places of '
 'the body and causing a potential brain aneurysm or stroke.',
 'will match outside pressure by decreasing fluid speed, starving the body of '
 'oxygen.',
 'is at risk of over-oxidizing, dangerously increasing pressure.']
A is correct. When the surgeons cut into the artery, blood will obviously shoot out of the body as a result of blood pressure. That pressure is converted to kinetic energy, causing the blood to move rapidly as it exits the body.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A man is accidentally exposed to a toxin which binds irreversibly and noncompetitively to pyruvate dehydrogenase. A likely consequence of this ingestion is:
['a decrease in lactic acid concentration in exposed cells.',
 'an increase in the concentration of acetyl-CoA in exposed cells.',
 'a decrease in the level of Krebs cycle activity within the exposed cells.',
 'an increased rate of formation of NADH in exposed cells.']
C is correct. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the enzyme that mediates pyruvate decarboxylation. This step is the critical link between anaerobic and aerobic respiration. With this link broken, cells would be limited to anaerobic respiration. Thus, a decrease in aerobic respiration makes sense in this context.

A: Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic respiration. With pyruvate decarboxylation blocked, the cell would likely see an increase in such products.

B, D: Acetyl-CoA and NADH are products of pyruvate decarboxylation. Blocking this enzyme would lower these concentrations.

If a lung is punctured, what effect will this likely have on breathing? 
['The lung will fill in with blood from the surrounding intrapleural pace, '
 'leaving less room for oxygen.',
 'The punctured lung will be unable to inflate, affecting inhalation.',
 'Breathing will be painful, but otherwise unaffected.',
 'All air will rush out of the lung and inhalation will be impossible.']
B is correct. During typical breathing, the diaphragm contracts, flattening it and increasing the volume of the intrapleural space. As a result, the lungs expand and the pressure inside them decreases. The resulting pressure differential between the lungs and the atmosphere causes air to rush in, a process termed inspiration. If the lungs are punctured, air will flow freely between the lung and the intrapleural space, and the lung will not expand (since no pressure differential can be maintained). Expansion of the thoracic cavity should still lead to some air flow into the lung, however, although it will also mix freely with the thoracic cavity's air, making it more difficult to absorb oxygen within the damaged lung while also making it harder to maintain a pressure differential with the other lung. Thus, B is definitely true.

A: The surrounding intrapleural space includes a small amount of fluid, but the lungs are not submerged in blood.

C: Breathing will certainly be adversely affected in cases of a puncture.

D: This is an extreme answer ("all" air). Additionally, air would not rush out of the lung unless the lung were under higher pressure than the surroundings, which is likely untrue.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a part of the respiratory system? 
['The epiglottis', 'The lacteals', 'The larynx', 'The right bronchus']
B is correct. This is a straightforward anatomy question with no information from the passage needed. The lacteals are structures in the intestines associated with absorbing fat into the lymphatic system.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is an accurate statement regarding mitosis and meiosis?
['Mitosis results in two haploid daughter cells.',
 'During mitosis and meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated.',
 'During meiosis I and meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated.',
 'Meiosis I results in two diploid daughter cells.']
B

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The disruption of which membrane component is most likely to result in cellular traffic complications similar to those seen in gap junction disorders? 
['Cholesterol', 'Glycoproteins', 'Glycolipids', 'Phospholipids']
B is correct. The cell membrane is composed of several different components, each responsible for different functions. Membrane transport is most likely to be affected if the disruption occurs in components that span the entire membrane. Transmembrane proteins (many of which are glycoproteins) are the only component listed that pass all the way through the cell membrane and facilitate membrane transport.

A: Cholesterol does not facilitate membrane traffic, nor does it extend across the entire membrane.

C, D: Phospholipids and glycolipids are located on the surface of cell membranes and typically do not extend though the entire bilayer. Glycolipids act to provide energy and also serve as markers for cellular recognition. Phospholipids are a structural component of the membrane and are not involved in traffic/transport.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What type of control does siRNA exert on G6P expression? 
['Transcriptional control',
 'Promotion',
 'Repression',
 'Post-transcriptional control']
D is correct. Due to its structure, siRNA is only able to bind to other RNA strands, not to DNA or protein. Therefore, it must interfere with gene expression after transcription has already occurred, but before translation. Specifically, it prevents the translation of mRNA corresponding to the target protein.

A, B, C: These controls occur before transcription. In contrast, siRNA prevents mRNA from being translated.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In severe diabetic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), insulin cannot effectively induce the uptake of glucose by cells. Hyperglycemia directly leads to the presence of which of these molecules in the urine? 
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
C is correct. This question requires outside knowledge about glucose metabolism. If cells cannot take up glucose, it will remain in the blood and eventually be excreted in the urine when it builds up to the point that it cannot be reabsorbed by the nephron. In a state of hyperglycemia, the body relies on fat metabolism to generate energy, which produces ketone bodies that are also excreted in the urine. Therefore, Roman numerals II and III are correct.

I: Proteins in the urine are not the result of hyperglycemia, but rather damage to the glomerulus.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Meiosis I results in: 
['2 diploid cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 2 sister '
 'chromatids.',
 '2 haploid cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 1 '
 'chromatid.',
 '2 haploid cells with 23 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 2 sister '
 'chromatids.',
 '2 diploid cells with 23 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of 1 '
 'chromatid.']
C is correct. Meiosis I results in 2 haploid cells, each with 23 chromosomes consisting of 2 sister chromatids per chromosome. In the male, the sister chromatids are split into 4 gametes during meiosis II. For females, meiosis I results in a secondary oocyte (a gamete) and a polar body. Penetration of the secondary oocyte by a sperm brings on anaphase II. Telophase II produces a zygote and a second polar body. Remember for the MCAT: mitosis results in diploid daughter cells, while meiosis results in haploid cells to produce gametes.
 
A: Neither meiosis nor mitosis results in 46 chromosomes with 2 sister chromatids. In mitosis, the sister chromatids separate to create daughter cells with 46 chromosomes, each chromosome consisting of a single chromatid.

B: Haploid cells have 23 chromosomes.

D: Diploid cells have 46 chromosomes.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Uracil is usually found in: 
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II only', 'I, II, and III']
C is correct. Uracil is found in any structure made of RNA. Both tRNA and ribosomes are made of RNA. Single-stranded DNA would have thymine rather than uracil

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is a kinship of affinity?
['Grandparents rearing their grandchildren',
 'Extended families living in the same household',
 'A husband and wife merging their children from a previous marriage',
 'Divorced parents sharing custody of their children']
C is correct. A kinship of affinity is one in which individuals are related by choice, such as through marriage, rather than through blood, such as the other choices.
 
A, B, D: All of these choices describe blood relations.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following was NOT a finding by Harry Harlow in his experiments with rhesus monkeys and their pairing with a simulated mother made from wire (Wire Mother) or one made from soft cloth (Cloth Mother)?
['Monkeys paired with Wire Mothers drank similar amounts of milk and grew at a '
 'rate comprable to monkeys paired with Cloth Mothers.',
 'Monkeys paired with a Wire Mother sought soothing from their "mothers," but '
 'at a rate less than monkeys paired with Cloth Mothers.',
 "After early neglectful conditions, monkeys' abnormal behavior could be "
 'corrected by pairing them with the appropriate simulated mother.',
 'When given a choice, monkeys spent more time holding Cloth Mothers than Wire '
 'Mothers.']
C is correct. In Harlow's experiment, the infant monkeys preferred spending their time clinging to the cloth mother. Even when only the wire mother could provide food, the monkeys visited her just to eat. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the mother/infant relationship than milk and that this "contact comfort" was crucial to the psychological development and health of infants. After monkeys were paired with a Wire Mother, they showed abnormal behavior, which could not be corrected later in life by pairing them with a Cloth Mother.
 
A: This is true. Monkeys with both Cloth and Wire Mothers drank similar amounts and grew similar amounts.

B: This is true. In fact, monkeys paired with Wire Mothers very rarely sought soothing from their "mothers" at all and went almost only to eat.

D: This is true. Monkeys held Cloth Mothers more than Wire Mothers when given a choice.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What characteristics of society are associated with high levels of anomie?
['I and II only', 'I and III only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
D is correct. Anomie refers to society feeling fragmented and lacking cohesiveness. All of the characteristics listed are associated with anomie.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What part of the brain is likely to be more active while playing a song on the piano for the thousandth time from memory in comparison to playing it for the first time while reading the sheet music? 
['Frontal lobe', 'Temporal lobe', 'Cerebellum', 'Parietal lobe']
C is correct. The cerebellum is responsible for muscle memory and coordination. When playing the song for the thousandth time, it will be played mostly from muscle memory.

A: Frontal lobe is primarily involved in reward, planning, motivation, and inhibitions. It also houses the motor cortex, which controls movement, but that is likely to be equally activated regardless of how well-known the piece of music is.

B: The temporal lobe is involved in memory, but this sort of muscle memory is more likely to be cerebellar in nature.

D: The parietal lobe is involved primarily in regulating and interpreting sensory data and would not be more active while playing a well-known piece.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A public health advocacy group has developed a program to encourage adherence to a Truvada medication regimen using operant conditioning principles. An example of the group using thinning in the program is: 
['reducing the number of participants in the program.',
 'reducing the prompts used to remind participants to take medication.',
 'reducing the frequency of rewards for medication compliance.',
 'changing the reinforcement schedule from variable to continuous.']
C is correct. In operant conditioning, thinning refers to reducing the frequency of rewards for a given action.

A: This is not an example of thinning in operant conditioning.

B: This is known as fading in operant conditioning.

D: This is close to a sensible answer, but the reinforcement schedule would need to be changed from continuous to variable.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In respect to peer relationships and self-esteem, late physical maturation in pubescents has been found to have which of the following effects? 
['Positive effects for females and positive effects for males',
 'Positive effects for females and negative effects for males',
 'Negative effects for females and positive effects for males',
 'Negative effects for females and negative effects for males']
B is correct. Females tend to benefit from maturing later, due in part to feeling less self-conscious about body image. In contrast, males tend to feel more self-conscious if they develop later.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

How could researchers design a study to specifically determine whether there is institutional, but not individual, discrimination at a particular organization?
['Compare the demographics of individuals hired at the organization with the '
 'demographics at similar organizations',
 'Compare the demographics of individuals hired by several hiring directors '
 'within the organization',
 'Neither A nor B',
 'Both A and B together']
D is correct. Both A and B are required here. Method A could show that there is a difference between organizations with regard to hiring practices, which implies institutional discrimination. Method B could show that no individual discrimination is present.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

According to Erikson's stages of development, which basic conflict would the individuals studied by the researchers experience? 
['Generativity vs. stagnation',
 'Intimacy vs. isolation',
 'Ego integrity vs. despair',
 'Identity vs. role confusion']
C is correct. Ego integrity vs. despair is a basic conflict that emerges when an individual reaches maturity (at 65 and older) and is reflecting on his or her life.

A: Generativity vs. stagnation is a basic conflict that occurs during middle adulthood (ages 40-65), when individuals are trying to balance employment and being parents.

B: Intimacy vs. isolation occurs during young adulthood (19-40 years), when individuals need to form intimate relationships with other people.

D: Identity vs. role confusion occurs during adolescence (12 to 18 years), when teens are trying to develop social relationships with others and find a sense of self or personal identity.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Many elderly individuals struggle with the concept of death and dying. The Kübler-Ross model provides a series of stages that most people experience when facing the end of their life. Which of the following is the correct sequence of emotional stages from this model?
['Anger, denial, depression, acceptance, bargaining',
 'Denial, depression, bargaining, anger, acceptance',
 'Bargaining, anger, depression, denial, acceptance',
 'Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance']
D is correct. For these stages, you can remember the acronym Death Always Brings Definite Acceptance. The stages are sequenced in the following order: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An individual who scores highly on a measure of positive feelings towards the culture to which he immigrated and low on a measure of positive feelings towards his native culture would likely be employing what strategy of acculturation?
['Assimilation', 'Separation', 'Marginalization', 'Integration']
A is correct. Assimilation is a strategy in which the individual seeks to interact with the new culture and reject the native culture.
 
B: Separation is rejecting the new culture and maintaining the native culture.

C: Marginalization involves the rejection of both cultures.

D: Integration involves identifying with both cultures.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A shopper behaves very aggressively towards another shopper and, in response, the store manager refuses to sell a coveted toy to the shopper. This experience would most likely serve as: 
['positive punishment.',
 'negative reinforcement.',
 'negative punishment.',
 'positive reinforcement.']
C is correct. Here, something is being taken away from the shopper - the opportunity to purchase a particular item - which makes this a negative reaction. Remember that positive responses in operant condition involve adding something (giving a food pellet, giving a shock) but negative ones involve removing somethings (removing a noxious noise, removing food). Since the action is something the shopper would not want, it is more likely that the aggressive behavior would decrease rather than increase, making it a punishment.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What group phenomenon was most likely responsible for the aggressive behavior seen at Store 2?
['Social loafing', 'Deindividuation', 'Social facilitation', 'Social control']
B is correct. Based on the data in Tables 1 and 2, we can see that there are a large number of violent incidents happening, along with a wide range of violent behavior. Deindividuation refers to a situation where a person doesn't feel like they are accountable for their actions based on the actions of others in the group. They temporarily "lose" their identity, meaning things they usually value about themselves (like being polite or patient while shopping) don't impact their behavior as much as what they observe around them.
 
A: Social loafing refers to a situation where an individual does not pull his/her weight in a group setting.

C: Social facilitation refers to improved performance while in the presence of a group.

D: Social control refers to enforcement of conformity. This could be what is happening in store 1, where people are courteous and excited at the store.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Shopper A, a customer at Store 3, rudely screams at a staff member. He then receives a discount plus a free item from the manager while checking out. Shopper B witnesses the event. When it is her turn to check out, she behaves rudely and screams at the staff member too. Which theory best describes how she learned this behavior? 
['Social cognitive theory',
 'Classical conditioning theory',
 'Operant conditioning theory',
 'Cognitive dissonance theory']
A is correct. Social cognitive theory asserts that people learn by watching others, and if they see someone is rewarded for a behavior, they are more likely to behave that way too.

B: Classical conditioning involves pairing two stimuli to produce a specific response.

C: Operant conditioning uses reinforcement or punishment to increase or decrease likelihood of an individual's behavior. In this case, the first rude shopper was reinforced for acting like a jerk, so he is more likely to behave that way in the future, but the second shopper hasn't had any consequences to increase or decrease her rude behavior.

D: Dissonance theory refers to a conflict between beliefs and actions that leads to changes in behavior.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The media portrayal of shoppers who are violent and aggressive or who misbehave on Black Friday in order to shame or ridicule them is an example of what type of social control?
['Formal positive sanction',
 'Formal negative sanction',
 'Informal negative sanction',
 'Informal positive sanction']
C is correct. An informal sanction is an action by a peer or group of peers that is meant to make behavior more normative. It usually involves shaming or ridicule, which is considered a punishment. When the media shames people who engage in non-normative behavior (acting like a jerk while shopping), they are trying to enforce norms in an informal way.
 
A: A formal positive sanction is an official reward for an action or behavior. For example, individuals who help others in a crisis are often given a reward or a medal for doing so.

B: A formal negative sanction is an official punishment for an action or behavior; for example, a customer who was violent with others may be banned from a store for life - this is a consequence enforced by a group or organization, the business or store.

D: The media did not reward the behavior exhibited, so this is not a positive sanction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following steps could an organization take to make itself into a more ideal bureaucracy?
['Making distinctions between management and employees less pronounced',
 'Cross-training employees to be proficient in different skills',
 'Evaluating how decisions impact stock price in an "up-focused" organization',
 'Promoting individuals until they reach a level above their skill set']
C is correct. The motivation of an up-focused organization is to provide returns to shareholders. An ideal bureaucracy will make decisions in accordance with its mission.
 
A: Ideal bureaucracies should have a hierarchical structure.

B: Employees should be specialized in an ideal bureaucracy.

D: One criticism of bureaucracies is that employees are promoted until they become insufficiently competent for their positions.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is most likely to form a coordination compound with nickel?
['CH4', 'BF3', 'PH3', 'NH4+']
- C. PH3

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Given the following balanced reaction occurring in a
['Adding more H2', 'Adding more NH3', 'Removing NH3', 'Adding more N2']
B. Adding more NH3

Which of the following statements is/are NOT true of
['I only', 'II & III', 'III only', 'I, II & III']
- B. II & III

Which of the following statements concerning quantum numbers is NOT accurate?
['The principle quantum number is proportional to the energy level of the atom',
 'The azimuthal quantum number describes the subshell where the electron is '
 'located',
 'The magnetic quantum number specifies which of the orbitals holds the '
 'electron',
 'The electron spin quantum number differentiates between two electrons in the '
 'same orbital']
A) is only generally true. Recall that a 3d orbital is actually higher in energy than a 4s. The remaining three
answer choices are all completely accurate regarding quantum numbers —make sure you know them!

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The reactivity of metals with water increases going down a family in the periodic table. This trend is best explained by:
['Increasing flash point',
 'Increasing electron affinity',
 'Decreasing electronegativity',
 'Decreasing ionization energy']
D. Decreasing ionization energy

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Whats the best way to solve this problem?
['Ca2+ + H2O(l) → H2(g) + CaO(s)',
 'Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca2+ + H2(g) + 2OHC.',
 'Ca2+ + 2H2O(l) → Ca(s) + 2H2(g) + O2(g)']
- Don't be intimidated by this type of question. Look at your possibilities and rule out nonsense . Since we were told that solid calcium, not ionic calcium, is reacting with water, rule out A and D. Answer choice B shows water turning from liquid to vapor apparently spontaneously as solid calcium loses two electrons to form Ca 2+. If you didn't know it already, REDOX reaction always occur in pairs. Things don't lose electrons unless they go ONTO something else that is reduced. As a good exercise, try tracking where the electrons are going in the reaction for answer B, which is the correct answer

 -------------------------------------------------- 

NH3 is a liquid at room temperature, while AsH3
['Electronegativity',
 'Intermolecular forces',
 'Ionization energy',
 'Molecular weight']
- it is a better answer because it is more general and would include all of the intermolecular forces that usually account for a compound's state as solid, liquid, or gas

How many hydrogen atoms are present in 2.0 grams of
['1.33 x 1023', '6.67 x 10-1', '6.67 x 1022', '2.22 x 10-1']
A. 1.33 x 10^22

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A chemist could identify the order of zinc in the rate law for the equation given below by performing which of the following procedures in the lab? (Note: Sulfuric acid is known to be a first order reactant)
['Graph the [Zn], ln[Zn] and 1/[Zn] versus time while holding the [H2SO4] '
 'constant.',
 'Graph the [Zn], ln[Zn] and 1/[Zn] versus time while varying the [H2SO4].',
 'Graph the [Zn], ln[Zn] and 1/[Zn] versus time while holding the [H2SO4] in '
 'excess.',
 'The order of Zn is already known because solid reactants are always zero '
 'order and therefore omitted from the rate law.']
To determine the order of Zn the chemist needs to remove the effect of sulfuric acid, the other reactant, because we know it is first order and therefore affecting rate. Putting it in excess makes it effectively zero order under those conditions and any effect remaining must be due solely to Zn. This makes C the best answer. Answers A and B would both result in both reactants affecting rate and there fore none of the graphs would be linear. Answer D is false. Solids do affect rate. It is trying to confuse you with the fact that solids and liquids are always le ft out of the formula for the equilibrium constant (Keq).

Iron is lustrous, ductile, malleable and reacts in water to form rust. The ionization energies for iron are 5.0 x 10-20 J, 3.1 x 10-19 J, and 2.0 x 10-18 J, respectively, for n = 4, n = 3 and n = 2. 
['2.6 x 10-19/h', '2.6 x 10-19*h', '3.1 x 10-19/h + Ф', '3.1 x 10-19/h']
A ; The key to this question is recalling the formula for the energy o f a photon, E = hf. The frequency in term so f h will be f = E/h. The energy o f the photon will be equal to the energy difference be tween the two energy levels. In this case, 31 x 10-20 - 5 x 10-20 = 26 x 10-20, or 2.6 x 10-19. This rules out Answers C and D. As demonstrated, the energy should be divided by h, not multiplied.

The most naturally abundant iron isotope, 56Fe, decays to form 56Mn. During the decay process, which of the following could have occurred?
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II', 'I, II and III']
D. I, II and III

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following provides the best explanation for why a solution containing Mn2+ is colorless while an equimolar solution of Mn4+ is brown?
['Mn2+ has fewer valence electrons to participate in energy transitions than '
 'does Mn4+.',
 'Mn2+ exhibits energy transitions in the visible spectrum while Mn4+ does '
 'not.',
 'Mn4+ absorbs light in the visible spectrum while Mn2+ does not.',
 'Mn4+ has a greater number of protons to attract scattered light than does '
 'Mn2+.']
C. Mn4+ absorbs light in the visible spectrum while Mn2+ does not.

All of the following would be found in higher than average concentrations in muscle cells, EXCEPT:
['hemoglobin', 'nuclei', 'glycogen', 'microfilaments']
A. hemoglobin

Trial 1 measures the maximum lifting force of a live rat bicep muscle. Trial 2 measures the ex vivo lifting force of the same muscle under electrical stimulation. Assuming that ex vivo function mirrors in vivo function, which result is expected?
['The value obtained for Trial 1 will be greater than that for Trial 2.',
 'The value obtained for Trial 2 will be greater than that for Trial 1',
 'All things being equal, Trial 1 will equal Trial 2.',
 'Trial 2 will be greater than Trial 1, but electrical stimulation cannot '
 'accurately mimic in vivo muscle contraction.']
The lifting capacity o f the removed muscles should be many, many times greater attached directly to a weight than it would be in the body. This is because in vivo the insertion point is very near the point of rotation, creating the reverse o f a machine: an apparatus that increases the force necessary to accomplish a set amount of work . Many students choose answer D, but note that the question stem pretty clearly tells you to ignore this concern. This type o f answer choice—one where they make some blanket
statement that discredits the premise o f the question—are common on the MCAT and are usually wrong. Always ask yourself, "Is that basic science knowledge?" Exactly whether or not this in vitro test could mimic in vivo conditions is very specific, esoteric information that you wouldn't be expected to know.

Which of the following explains the rapid onset of brain damage when blood flow to the brain is interrupted?
['Neurons have a higher blood volume requirement than do other somatic cells.',
 'Neurons are frozen in G0 phase and are thus incapable of storing glucose.',
 'Neurons have low glycogen stores and no mechanism for oxygen storage.',
 'Neurons are unable to divide and thus require a constant perfusion of blood.']
C. Neurons have low glycogen stores and no mechanism for oxygen storage.

['The net flow of water out of the descending loop of Henle would decrease',
 'The permeability of the renal collecting duct would increase',
 'Aldosterone levels would increase',
 'The net flow of ions out of the ascending loop of Henle would decrease']
A. The net flow of water out of the descending loop of Henle would decrease

 "The newly formed strand is modified with a polyA tail and a 5' cap.",
 'The newly formed strand contains fewer nucleotides than the original '
 'chromosome']
D. The newly formed strand contains fewer nucleotides than the original chromosome

Hemophilia, a disease that causes excessive bleeding due to reduced ability of the blood to clot, is X-linked recessive. If a carrier female marries an affected male, and they have two children, what is the probability that they will both be affected males?
['1/16', '1/32', '1/8', '1/4']
A. 1/16

 The easiest way to approach this problem is to calculate the probability o f any boy child being affected and
then square that fraction due to the fact that they both must happen. There is a ½ chance that a child will ge t
the Y allele from his or her father. If the child gets this Y, it will be a boy, and there will be a ½ chance that the
X he ge ts from his m other will be the abnormal allele instead o f the normal allele (recall that she is a carrier
only, not affected). That gives us ½ times ½ = ¼. This must happen twice , so we multipley ¼ by ¼ and ge t
1/16, answer A. Most students are surprised to realize that the chance is exactly the sam e for having two
a ffected fem ale children. Take a m om ent to figure out why this is true .

Most insects have an open circulatory system. A new organism similar to insects is discovered that has a closed circulatory system. In trying to determine whether to classify the new organism as an insect, or to classify it with higher-order organisms, biologist discover that in the larval stage the organism has an open circulatory system which only later develops into a closed system. This discovery provides:
['evidence in favor of c',
 'evidence that in this organism a closed',
 'no evidence in favor of either decision as long as the new organism can '
 'breed with insects and provide viable offspring']
A. evidence in favor of classifying the organism with

The inability to curl one's tongue is a recessive trait. In a given population of 1,000 individuals randomly mating with one another, 90 cannot curl their tongue. How many members of this population have the recessive allele but can still curl their tongue?
['420', '700', '300', '810']
A ; This is a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium question. Use the formulas p 2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 and p + q = 1. Divide 90/1000 to get 0.09, the fraction o f people who cannot curl their tongue. This represents q 2. This is the step where most students mess up, deciding what the numbers represent. The allele frequencies are the individual letters, p and q. The prevalence among individuals com es from the squared letters. So , to get the allele frequency, we must take the square root o f 0.09, which is 0.3. Now we know q and can subtract from 1 to get p, which is 0.7. 2pq always gives the frequency o f carriers, which is 2(.3)(.7) = .42, or 42%. Forty -two percent o f 1,000 is answer A, 420

Researchers often consider a ratio between nucleotide bases, such as the A to T ratio, as a way of describing nucleotide polymers such as DNA. Which of the following would NOT be expected for the ratio of C to A (C/A)? (Note: assume no errors or mutations) 
['The C/A ratio of the DNA template strand must be identical to the C/A ratio '
 'of the pre-mRNA transcript.',
 'The C/A ratio of the DNA coding strand will differ from the C/A ratio of the '
 'mature mRNA transcript.',
 'The C/A ratio of the DNA template strand will exactly equal the G/U ratio of '
 'the pre-mRNA transcript.',
 'The C/A ratio of the parental DNA helix will equal the C/A ratio of each '
 'newly replicated daughter helix.']
A. The C/A ratio of the DNA template strand must be identical to the C/A ratio of the pre-mRNA transcript.

 Students should carefully think through what any such ratio represents. The ratio o f two bases that are com plementary, such as A/T or C/G will exhibit different patterns than a ratio between two bases that do not pair, such as A/G, G/T, C/A, etc. Answer A would NOT be expected and is there fo re the correct answer. To illustrate, assume the template strand has the sequence 5' CCCA 3'. The C/A ratio would be 3/1. The pre-mRNA transcript would be 3' GGGU 5'. As you can see, in this particular example there would be no C or A bases in the pre-mRNA transcript. Answer A is true and therefore incorrect. The C/A ratio of the coding strand and the mature mRNA must differ because of the excision o f introns. Answer C is also true , and there fore incorrect. Because C and G pair and A and U pair, they must exist in a one-to-one ratio between template strand and premRNA strand. Finally, Answer D is true and there fore incorrect. The ratios o f any bases must be identical be tween parent and daughter strands following DNA replication because—barring any errors—daughter strands are identical copies o f their parent strand.

['Cognitive bias',
 'Functional fixedness',
 'Mental set',
 'Availability heuristi']

C. The 5-year-old child has not had the experience needed to assign purpose to an object

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In a study of cognition, researchers observed children of various ages at play. After 10 minutes of play, researchers took away the children'stoys and put themin a box. Some children went to the box, opened it, and retrieved the toys. Other children became frustrated, but made no attempt to open the box. These children were exhibiting differing levels of progress in which of Piaget's developmental stages?
['Concrete operational', 'Formal operational', 'Sensorimotor', 'Preoperational']
C. Sensorimotor

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A parent covers a child's snack with a bowl, and the child reacts by flipping the bowl over to retrieve the snack. The parent offers milk to the child in two identically-sized glasses, and the child chooses the glass that is most full. The parent pours the milk from the glass that was most full into a wider glass, making the level of the milk lower in that glass, than in the glass originally rejected by the child. The child then selects the glass he originally rejected. Which statement best explains this scenario?
['The child has mastered the formal operational stage of cognitive '
 'development, but is still struggling with the concrete operational stage of '
 'cognitive development.',
 'The child has developed a sense of object permanence, but has not mastered '
 'the concept of constancy.',
 'The child has mastered the preoperational stage of cognitive development, '
 'but is still progressing through the sensorimotor stage of cognitive '
 'development.',
 'The child has mastered the concept of reversibility, but has not yet '
 'mastered a systematic approach to problem solving.']
B. The child has developed a sense of object permanence, but has not mastered the concept of constancy.

 'Incentive theory of emotion']
C. Schachter-Singer theory of emotion

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A student creates two electrolytic cells, one containing a salt solution of CuSO4 ions at the cathode and the other containing a salt solution of FeSO4 ions at the cathode. Using a voltmeter, it is determined that an external voltage of 0.62V is required to force a reaction at the cathode in the CuSO4 solution and 0.95V is required to force a reaction at the cathode in the FeSO4 solution. Assuming the same electrode and solution are used at the anode in both cases, which of the following conclusions is justifiable?
['Cu2+ has a higherreduction potential than Fe2+',
 'Fe2+ has a higher reduction potential than Cu2+',
 'Cu2+ is a better reducing agent than Fe2+',
 'Fe2+ is a better oxidizing agent than Cu2+']
- A. Cu2+ has a higherreduction potential than Fe2+

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The following reaction occurs during the first step of
['NADH is oxidized and Complex I is reduced',
 'NADH is reduced and Complex I is oxidized',
 'NADH is oxidized, but Complex I is NOT reduced',
 'Both NADH and Complex I are reduced as two protons are pumped into the inner '
 'membrane space']
- "it takes two to tango" NADH is obviously oxidized which means complex I must be reduced

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Given the following unbalanced reaction, which of the following correctly identifies the oxidizing and reducing agents?
['Iron(II)sulfate is the reducing agent and oxygen is the oxidizing agent',
 'Iron(III)sulfate is the oxidizing agent and water is the reducing agent',
 'Iron(II)sulfate is the oxidizing agent and H+ is the reducing agent',
 'Iron(III)sulfate and hydrogen are both oxidizing agents and sulfate and '
 'oxygen are both reducing agents']
- B. Iron(III)sulfate is the oxidizing agent and water is the reducing agent

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The formation of rust on metal is an oxidation process involving water that is catalyzed by the presence of salt. Given this information, which of the following would be expected to have the highest reduction potential, E˚?
['an old rusted nail',
 'a polyurethane pipe',
 'a polymer coated wire',

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Utilizing the information in Table 1, which of the following gives the Gibbs Free Energy for Reaction 1?
['∆H - T∆S', '∆Gproducts - ∆Greactants', '-(3)(F)(+6.36)', '-(2)(F)(+3.86)']
D. -(2)(F)(+3.86) there are two moles of electrons transferred, so we know D is the correct answer

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Reaction 1 is one of several steps carried out during the industrial manufacture of hydrochloric acid. Instead of a galvanic cell, however, an electrolytic cell is utilized. Which of the following gives the location of the formation of chloride and potassium ions during the industrial application of Reaction 1?
['Cl ions at the anode and K ions at the cathode',
 'Cl ions at the cathode and K ions at the anode',
 'Both ions at the cathode',
 'Both ions at the anode']
B. Cl ions at the cathode and K ions at the anode

Which of the following statements is/are true of an electrolytic cell?
['I and II', 'II and III', 'II, III and IV', 'I, II and IV']
D. I, II and IV

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a difference between a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell?
['the sign of the anode and cathode',
 'the sign of ∆G',
 'the external voltage source applied',
 'the net gain or loss of electrons']
D; Answer A IS a difference between a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell, the signs of the anode and cathode are reversed. Answer B is also a difference; galvanic cells are spontaneous while electrolytic cells are not. Answer C is also true, an external voltage is required for an electrolytic cell, but not for a galvanic. Answer D, however, is not true. In both cases, the net gain or loss of electrons for the system is zero . Electrons are not gained or lost overall, only transferred.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A favorable process and it would thus need to have a large, positive E˚or negative E˚?
['large, positive E˚',
 'large, negative E˚',
 'small, negative ∆G',
 'large, positive ∆G']

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When K=1, Gibb's free energy is equal to?
['1 > ∆G', '1 < ∆G', 'K < 1', 'K = 1']
- zero
- A. 1 > ∆G, if a spontaneous reaction has a ∆G which is negative, than 1 would definitely be greater than ∆G

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Inside a sealed 45L reaction vessel, a sample of methane gas is completely combusted with O2 to form water vapor and carbon dioxide. If there are 3 total moles of gas after the reaction is complete, and the reaction vessel is cooled to 0˚C, which of the following gives the partial pressure of CO2?
['3 atm', '0.33 atm', '0.5 atm', '1.5 atm']
C. 0.5 atm. Compared to STP, the moles have tripled, making the pressure triple from 1 to 3 atm. Also compared to STP , the volume has doubled form 22.4L to 45L, causing the pressure to be cut in half from 3 atm to 1.5atm. We now know the total pressure . The mole fraction can be deduced from writing a balanced equation for the reaction. We see that there will be 2 moles o f water vapor for every 1 mole of carbon dioxide. This means the m ole fraction o f carbon dioxide is 1/3. Multiply this by the total pressure for a partial pressure of 0.5 atm

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The law for diffusion of gases, states that?
['0.85 meters from the NO2 beaker',
 '0.85 meters from the SO2 beaker',
 '0.53 meters from the SO2 beaker',
 '0.53 meters from the NO2 beaker']
- the ratio of the velocities of two gases is proportional to the INVERSE of the ratio of the square root of their m olar mass. This means that VNO2 over the VSO2 is equal to the ratio of the square root o f 64 (the MM o f sulfur dioxide) over the square root o f 46 (the MM o f nitrogen dioxide). This simplifies to 8/7
- D. 0.53 meters from the NO2 beaker

 -------------------------------------------------- 

There are several copper chlorides that differ only in the oxidation number of copper. Each of them creates a blue solution when dissolved in water proportional to the number of copper ions in solution. Which of the following would produce a solution with the lightest blue color?
['CuCl; Ksp = 1 x 10-4',
 'CuCl2 ; Ksp = 1 x 10-1',
 'CuCl3; Ksp = 1 x 10-6',
 'All three would produce the same amount of blue color']
A. CuCl; Ksp = 1 x 10-4

If they form DIFFERENT numbers of ions, you must either calculate the actual solubility for each, OR you can usually use this shortcut: Raise each Ksp to the 1/x power, where x is the number of ions formed in solution. Do the math, and compare the resulting numbers, which will approximate the actual solubilities. In this case, Answer C appears to have the smallest Ksp, meaning it would be the least soluble and would thus produce the lightest blue color. However, when you use the shortcut above, you should get 1 x 10-(6 x .25) which = 1 x 10-1.5 for Answer C and 1 x 10-(4 x .5) which = 1 x 10-2 for Answer A, making A the best answer

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following iron compounds is most soluble?
['FeCl3 ; Ksp = 1 x 10-12',
 'FeCl2 ; Ksp = 1 x 10-3',
 'FeCl; Ksp = 1 x 10-3',
 'Fe(NO2)3; Ksp = 1 x 10-3']
D results in the smallest negative number, which is the largest Ksp and thus the most soluble

 -------------------------------------------------- 

All of the following change with an increase in temperature, EXCEPT:
['Ksp', 'molarity', 'reaction rate', 'molality']
D. molality the mass of the solvent doesn't change with temperature, molality is NOT affected by temperature and D is thus correct

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A student begins a lab experiment by adding 996g of NaHCO3 to a beaker and then adding enough water to make 1 L of solution. Which of the following gives the molality of the solution?
['12 m', '1.2 m', '22 m', '30 m']
There are approximately 12 moles of bicarbonate in 996g of sodium bicarbonate. Molality is moles of solute/Kg of solvent, so we have the numerator. To get the Kg of solvent, first you must calculate the volume taken up by the solute. It is the total solution that is 1L; this is not the volume o f the solvent alone. Dividing 996g by 2.2g/mL gives 453mL. This tells us that only 547mL of water was added to the beaker to make 1L o f total solution. Finally, you must know that the density o f water is 1g/mL. This gives us 12moles/0.55Kg or 22 m, which is Answer C. This is a good time to point out that some MCAT answers may seem to be abnormally large, or small, or odd, or even unbelievable if you have any actual experience with the likely value o f particular numbers in the lab. You couldn't really get 996g of sodium bicarbonate to dissolve in 547mL of water. However, you would NEVER need to know that because the MCAT would never expect you to have memorized the solubility of bicarbonate in water. Remember, it's all basic science principles!

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Sulfates are usually insoluble, except when combined with?
['specific heat capacity',
 'heat capacity -1',
 'heats of vaporization, sublimation and evaporation',
 'phase changes']
- group 1A elements
- atmospheric pressure at that given temperature and will therefore boil sooner.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If 220 grams of CaCl2 is dissolved in water to produce 1 L of solution at room temperature,which of the following expressions gives the osmotic pressure of the solution?
['(3)(0.02)(8.31)(298)',
 '(2)(220)(0.0821)(298)',
 '(3)(1.25)(8.31)(10)(273)',
 '(3)(220)(0.0821)(298)/(110)']
D. (3)(220)(0.0821)(298)/(110) Answer D is the only one that divides by the molar mass and is thus the best answer. The version of R that makes the units work out correctly is 0.0821 L Atm/mol K

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The formula for freezing point depression is?
['The Ksp of CaCl2 (if the solution is saturated), or its molal concentration '
 'and the normal freezing point',
 'Molality of calcium chloride',
 'The number of ions formed in solution and the normal freezing point',
 'Molality of calcium chloride and the number of ions formed in solution']
- Kfmi
- A; The formula for freezing point depression is = Kfmi. Answer C , therefore, might be tempting because it includes the value for i. However, this isn't needed because it can be deduced form the formula given. Answer B, molality is needed, but without the normal freezing point, we cannot calculate the actual freezing point, only the freezing point depression. Answer D likewise does not provide the normal freezing point. The Ksp, Answer A, would be useful if the solution was saturated, but the molality of the calcium chloride would be useful in any case. With i and Kf it allows you to calculate the depression, which is applied to the normal freezing point

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The magnitude of ∆H of vaporization for water is significantly larger than that for ∆H of fusion for water.
['Vaporization requires energy and is thus positive, while fusion releases '
 'energy and is thus negative',
 'For vaporization to occur, relatively more intermolecular attractions must '
 'be overcome',
 'Fusion requires no breaking of ionic or covalent bonds as vaporization does, '
 'and thus requires less energy',
 'Vaporization is a phase change from liquid to gas,']
B. For vaporization to occur, relatively more intermolecular attractions must be overcome

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following species is more soluble in a CaBr2 solution than in an HCl solution?
['CuCl2', 'NaBr', 'CaSO4', 'CuBr2']
A. CuCl2

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If the Ksp of MgCO3 is known to be 9.4 x 10-4 M 2, what is the concentration of CO3 2- ions in a solution at equilibrium?
['1 x 10-4 M', '3.1 x 10-2 M', '9.4 x 10-4 M', '1.88 x 10-4 M']
B; Whenever you are asked for an actual solubility, you will need the Ksp to solve. You are given this, so you write the solubility equation: Ksp = [Mg 2+][CO32-]. Plug in the value given for Ksp and x for each of the two ions formed (because stoichiometry predicts that for every x moles o f magnesium carbonate dissolved you'll get x m oles of each ion). Solving for x requires you to take the square root of the Ksp. This is easily done by remembering that a number in scientific notation can be raised to the ½ power to take its square root. Recall that when an exponent is raised to another exponent you multiply them together. This gives -4 times ½, or an exponent of -2. Only answer B has the correct exponent. In other cases you'll usually need to also take the square root of the mantissa, which is really close to 3. Here it doesn't m atter because only B has the correct exponent

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A protein in a premolten globule state is beginning to?
['protein would b']
- collapse but is still in an extended state
- unfolded
- molten globule
- a collapsed state with well formed structural elements

 -------------------------------------------------- 

For instantaneous or constant velocity, Power is equal to what?
['certain airplane has a cruising speed of 240 m/s and a body mass of 60,000 '
 'kg. If the wind resistance produces a b']
P = FV(instantaneous)

You must first realize that since the airplane is traveling at constant velocity, the forward thrust provided by the engines must be equal to the backwards force of wind resistance. Since power is equal to force times velocity (for constant velocity situations), the answer is P = 240000 N × 240 m/s = 5.76 × 107 W

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A cross-sectional study is the analysis of?
['case-control study is an ob']
- data collected from a population or sample at one specific time (compared to across a time period for cohort studies). EXAMPLES: A survey of the U.S. population to determine the current prevalence of a disease; A study examines blood pressure among those with incomes above 100K/year and those below $100K. 
- individuals in the population with a condition present, and comparison of that group to a control group of persons without the disease in that same population (i.e., reference group)

All of the above

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Glucose typically enters the cell through which mechanism?
['Simple diffusion through the cell membrane',
 'Facilitated diffusion through a carrier protein',
 'Pinocytosis through a channel protein',
 'Active transport by a glucose transport protein']
Facilitated diffusion through a carrier protein

Glucose is too large and polar to move quickly through the cell membrane by simple diffusion.

Typically the concentration of glucose outside the cell is higher than inside the cell.

Since glucose is moving down a concentration gradient by entering the cell, the process does not require ATP.

Glucose typically enters cells by facilitated diffusion through a carrier protein.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which type of membrane protein is most likely to be a hormone?
['Lipid-bound protein', 'Peripheral protein', 'Integral protein', 'Steroid']
Peripheral protein

Hormones move through the circulatory system, acting as signaling molecules to specific organs/cells.

A steroid is not a membrane protein.

An integral protein can not easily leave the cell membrane and would therefore be a poor signaling molecule.

Lipid-bound proteins remain within the phospholipid bilayer by the fatty acid tails of phospholipids. They would also be poor signaling molecules.

Peptide hormones like insulin and growth hormone interact with integral protein receptors in cell membranes. These hormones can be considered peripheral membrane proteins.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Pulmonary edema occurs when fluid builds up in the interstitium between the pulmonary capillaries and the alveoli, and eventually enters the alveoli. How do you decrease the risk of pulmonary edema?
['Decrease hydrostatic pressure and increase osmotic pressure',
 'Decrease hydrostatic pressure and decrease osmotic pressure',
 'Increase hydrostatic pressure and decrease osmotic pressure',
 'Increase hydrostatic pressure and increase osmotic pressure']
Decrease hydrostatic pressure and increase osmotic pressure

Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure a liquid exerts on its container, and reflects the volume of liquid in a space.

Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent movement across a semipermeable membrane, and reflects the protein content of the blood.

To decrease the risk of pulmonary edema, hydrostatic pressure exerted by the fluid must decrease, and osmotic pressure exerted on the fluid must increase.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At what point does crossing over between sister chromatids occur?
['During anaphase I of meiosis',
 'During prophase I of meiosis',
 'During anaphase II of meiosis',
 'During prophase II of meiosis']
During prophase I of meiosis

Crossing over is a form of genetic recombination in which homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange pieces of their genetic material. Crossing over occurs in prophase I of meiosis, and is often referred to as synapsis. However, crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes, and not between the sister chromatids of an individual chromosome. Sister chromatids are identical pieces of DNA joined at the centromere to make up one chromosome.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Your trachea have short hair-like cell process that move the mucus. What is the name of these hair like structures and which cytoskeletal elements form them?
['Cilia, microfilaments',
 'Villi, microfilaments',
 'Villi, microtubules',
 'Cilia, microtubules']
Cilia, microtubules

Villi are macroscopic foldings of tissue

Microvilli are foldings of the cell membrane that increase the surface area of cell but are not responsible for movement

Cilia are eyelash like structures derived from microtubules, they are responsible for creating motion outside the cell.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An organic molecule has been isolated from the nucleus of a human cell. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal the core structure of the molecule to be a six-membered ring containing carbon and nitrogen. The ring also expresses an amine group and a keto group, and is attached to a five carbon sugar moiety. No phosphate groups are noted. What is the most likely identity of the molecule?
['Cytosine', 'Guanosine', 'Guanine', 'Cytidine']
Cytidine

First, realize that this question is asking you to identify a likely molecular component of the nucleus, DNA. DNA is largely made up of the nucleobases Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine.

When these bases are attached to a ribose moiety, the five carbon sugar described in the question, they are called "nucleosides", and are named as Adenosine, Guanosine, Cytidine, and Thymidine.

There are two main categories of nucleobases. Pyrimidines are made of a six membered heterocyclic ring of carbon and nitrogen with various substitutions on it's four carbon atoms. Purines are made of a pyrimidine plus an imidazole ring made of two nitrogens and a carbon atom.

Adenosine and Guanosine are nucleosides made from purines while Thymidine and Cytidine are made from pyrimidines.

The most likely identity of the molecule in question is Cytidine.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The synthesis of which of the following would be LEAST affected by a disease which selectively destroys the smooth endoplasmic reticulum?
['Testosterone', 'Phospholipids', 'Insulin', 'Cholesterol']
Insulin

The smooth ER is responsible for many functions, including the production of various lipid products and degradation of steroid hormones such as testosterone.Key steps in the synthesis of cholesterol occur within the smooth ER.

Insulin is a peptide hormone, which is a product of the translation of mRNA, which occurs in the cytoplasm.

The synthesis of Insulin would be least affected by a disease which destroys the smooth ER, but would be affected if the rough ER were affected.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Von Gierke disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme Glucose-6-phosphatase. Which of the following would most likely be observed in an individual with Von Gierke disease?
['Increased glycogen in the liver',
 'Decreased post-meal glycolysis',
 'Decreased glucose tolerance',
 'Increased gluconeogenesis']
Increased glycogen in the liver

Glucose-6-phosphatase hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate into a phosphate molecule plus glucose, which can then be used by cells to generate energy.

Without this enzyme, gluconeogenesis cannot be completed.

Glycolysis would not be affected, and glucose tolerance would be expected to be normal.

Glycogenolysis produces glucose-6-phosphate from glycogen stores in the body during times of fasting, or when blood glucose is low. However, without glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose cannot be made from glucose-6-phosphate. Therefore, the breakdown of glycogen is impaired in these individuals.

Increase glycogen in the liver would be expected in an individual with Von Gierke disease.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is an example of lower motor neuron dysfunction?
['An individual sits in a relaxed position with her knee partially flexed. '
 'When her foot is pulled upward, the individual involuntarily and '
 'rhythmically moves her foot up and down.',
 'An individual is told to relax her body. Despite attempts to relax, she '
 'experiences repeated, uncontrollable muscle spasticity.',
 'An individual is told to lift her left arm, and she has difficulty doing so. '
 'Her left arm appears shriveled and shorter than her right arm.',
 "A metal object is dragged along the bottom of an individual's foot and her "
 'toes go into extension away from the bottom of her foot.']
C. 
The extensor plantar response (or babinski reflex) is a sign of upper motor neuron dysfunction and can be seen when a noxious stimuli is placed on the bottom of the foot, causing the toes to go into extension away from the bottom of the foot, rather than flexing down in the direction of the bottom of the foot.

The involuntary rhythmic contraction of antagonist muscles is known as clonus and is a sign of upper motor neuron dysfunction.

Muscle spasticity is a feature of hypertonia, or increased tone of skeletal muscle, and is an upper motor neuron sign.

Extreme weakness and shrunken muscle is an example of atrophy, which is a sign of lower motor neuron dysfunction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The many steps of glycolysis all exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium between reactant and product concentrations. Which of the following actions does NOT affect the equilibrium position of a reaction?
['Adding or subtracting heat',
 'Adding or removing a catalyst',
 'Increasing or decreasing concentrations of reactants',
 'Increasing or decreasing volumes of reactants']
Adding or removing a catalyst

The equilibrium of a reaction can be changed by several factors. Adding or subtracting heat, choice (A), would shift the equilibrium based on the enthalpy change of the reaction. Increasing reactant concentrations would shift the equilibrium in the direction of the product, and the opposite would occur if reactant concentrations were decreased, eliminating choice (C). Changing the volume of a reactant would affect any reaction with gaseous reactants or products, eliminating choice (D). While adding or removing a catalyst would change the reaction rate, it would not change where the equilibrium lies.

The most effective method for producing an increase in the total amount of water lost through the skin during a certain period would be:
['inhibiting kidney function',
 'decreasing salt consumption',
 'raising the environmental temperature',
 'increasing water consumption']
raising the environmental temperature

This would cause a person to perspire, releasing water to the environment where it can evaporate and cool the body.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If oligonucleotides such as mRNA were not degraded rapidly by intracellular agents, which of the following processes would be most affected?
['the production of tRNA in the nucleus',
 'the coordination of cell differentiation during development',
 'the diffusion of respiratory gases across the cell membrane',
 'the replication of DNA in the nucleus']
the coordination of cell differentiation during development 
The destruction of mRNA prevents continuous protein production, allowing the cell to change its protein expression over time. The coordination of cell differentiation during development is very sensitive to the timing of mRNA turnover, while the other responses are not affected as much by the timing of mRNA turnover

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements about the systemic effect of bacterial cells are true?
['Gram-negative bacteria are more likely to cause systemic effects because '
 'their outer membrane protects them from several antibiotics, making '
 'treatment more difficult.',
 'Gram-positive bacteria are more likely to cause system effects because the '
 'peptidoglycan in their cell walls is tough and hard for medicine to '
 'penetrate.',
 'Gram-positive bacteria are more likely to cause systemic effects because the '
 'lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their membranes can act as a toxin to the '
 'circulatory system.',
 'Gram-negative bacteria are more likely to cause systemic effects because '
 'their lack of an outer membrane means they can more quickly infect host '
 'cells.']
The cell envelopes of gram-negative bacteria have more layers than those of gram-positive bacteria.

Gram-negative bacteria are considered to be more dangerous, because components of the outer membrane make them more resistant to antibiotics and the host's immune system. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide found in its outer membrane is an endotoxin that damages the host.

Scientists have developed a dye for galactose, which turns darker shades of blue as the concentration of this monosaccharide increases (dose dependent). In an experiment using bacteria that can metabolize both lactose and glucose, researchers set up test tubes as shown in Table 1. A plus sign indicates a sugar was added to the test tube, and a minus sign indicates the sugar is absent. Assuming bacterial concentrations stay constant, which test tube will show the strongest blue color?
['+ +', '+ -', '- +', '- -']
The lac operon that controls lactose digestion in prokaryotes normally operates at a very low basal level, and is upregulated by the presence of its substrate.

Lactose is a dimer of galactose and glucose.

The absence of glucose leads to an increase in cAMP, because now the cell must rely much more heavily on the lac operon for energy. This sets off a cascade of events that upregulate the enzymes that cleaves lactose.

The presence of lactose and absence of glucose will lead to the most galactose and thus will dye the most strongly blue (Answer B).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

While diving, when your heart rate and breathing rate are increase, you notice that you are producing more urine. Why?
['increased blood pressure caused by excitement or anxiety',
 'reduced blood pressure caused by excitement or anxiety',
 'absorption of water from the ocean',
 'inability to cool the skin through evaporative water loss']
increased blood pressure caused by excitement or anxiety 
increased urine production can be explained by an an increased blood pressure caused by adrenaline, released in response to excitement or anxiety - the flight or fight response

 -------------------------------------------------- 

After an accident, your physician detected the protein myoglobin in your urine. What type of injury is consistent with this observation?
['I only', 'III only', 'I and III only', 'II and III only']
II and III only
Myoglobin is the substance that holds oxygen in the muscles and organs. This observation is consistent with an injury to muscle or organs, but not bone.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which characteristic distinguishes fungi as eukaryotes?
['They have cell walls',
 'They contain ribosomes',
 'They contain mitochondria',
 'They exhibit sexual reproduction']
They contain mitochondria 
A characteristic that distinguishes eukaryotes from prokaryotes is that they contain membrane bound organelles

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Increased vasoconstriction has an important role in which of the following situations?
['Causing the decrease in blood pressure associated with fainting',
 'Increasing blood flow to muscle during exercise',
 'Increasing blood flow to skin during blushing',
 'Maintaining blood pressure during a hemorrhage']
Maintaining blood pressure during a hemorrhage 
As blood is lost from the circulation, reduction in vessel size helps maintain the necessary pressure to keep the blood circulating to all body tissues. Vasoconstriction, the narrowing or a vessel, restricts blood flow to an organ and can increase blood pressure, whereas vasodilation has the opposite effect. Vasodilation increases blood flow to both the muscle during exercise and the skin during blushing.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An intravenous infusion causes a sharp rise in the serum level of albumin (the major osmoregulatory protein in the blood). This will most likely cause an:
['increase in the immune response',
 'influx of tissue fluid to the bloodstream',
 'outflow of blood fluid to the tissues',
 'increase in tissue albumin levels']
influx of tissue fluid to the bloodstream
Albumin is one of the major plasma proteins. 
Plasma proteins can't cross the walls of the blood vessels, but water molecules can. The wall of the artery acts as a semipermeable membrane setting up the conditions needed for osmosis to occur. An increase in the plasma albumin will upset the osmotic balance because the blood will become hypertonic with respect to the tissue. Water will have to flow into the blood stream to reestablish equilibrium. So an increase in the plasma protein would cause fluid to enter the bloodstream

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Would an increase in the level of plasma aldosterone be expected to follow ingestion of excessive quantities of NaCl?
['No; aldosterone causes Na+ reabsorption in the kidney tubules',
 'No; aldosterone causes Na+ secretion by the kidney tubules',
 'Yes; aldosterone causes Na+ reabsorption by the kidney tubules',
 'Yes; aldosterone causes Na+ secretion by the kidney tubules']
No; aldosterone causes Na+ reabsorption in the kidney tubules

Aldosterone, which is produced in the adrenal cortex, causes Na+ reabsorption by kidney tubules. Such a mechanism decreases Na+ levels in the urine. The steroid aldosterone does not cause Na+ secretion into the urine. Because the ingestion of excessive NaCl would trigger Na+ secretion into the urine, plasma-aldosterone levels would not increase. Rather, the body would rely on those homeostatic mechanisms that excreted the excess Na+.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Most bacterial cells and human cells are alike in:
['the ability to produce ATP via ATP synthase',
 'the chemical composition of their ribosomes',
 'their enclosure within cell walls',
 'the shape of the self-replicating structures that carry their DNA']
the ability to produce ATP via ATP synthase
Both types of cells possess a membrane-embedded ETC capable of generating a H+ gradient, which drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. This ATP synthesis takes place on the plasma membrane of bacteria and on the inner mitochondrial membrane in human cells. 
The chemical composition of eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes are similar, but are distinct enough that several types of antibiotics are able to preferentially target prokaryotic ribosomes over eukaryotic ribosomes.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What would be the results of complete removal of the parathyroid glands?
['Severe neural and muscular problems due to deficiency of calcium in the '
 'plasma',
 'An increase in calcitonin production to compensate for calcium deficiency in '
 'the plasma',
 'A drastic change in the ratio of mineral to matrix tissue in bones',
 'Calcification of some organs due to accumulation of calcium in the plasma']
Severe neural and muscular problems due to deficiency of calcium in the plasma
Removal of the parathyroid gland would lead to hypocalcemia, a condition of low blood calcium, resulting from the lack of parathyroid hormone. This would cause increased neuromuscular excitability because of the change in membrane potential, which under normal physiological conditions, is partially kept in balance with the extracellular calcium.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Aldosterone stimulates Na+ reabsorption by the kidneys. What changes in the blood volume and pressure would be expected as a result of aldosterone deficiency? 
['Increased volume and increased pressure',
 'Decreased volume and decreased pressure',
 'Increased volume and decreased pressure',
 'Decreased volume and increased pressure']
Decreased volume and decreased pressure
An aldosterone deficiency would result in lower Na+ reabsorption in the kidney. Because water passively follows Na+ during reabsorption in the kidney, less Na+ reabsorption would result in less water reabsorption in the blood stream. This would cause a reduction in blood volume and pressure.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Of the following tissues, which is NOT derived from embryonic mesoderm? 
['Circulatory', 'Bone', 'Nerve', 'Dermal']
Nerve
Nervous tissue comes form ectoderm

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The chemical valinomycin inserts into membranes and causes the movement of K+ into the mitochondria. Based on the ETC, if mitochondria are treated with valinomycin, the rate of ATP synthesis in the mitochondria will most likely:
['decrease, because the K+will compete with protons at the active site on ATP '
 'synthetase',
 'decrease, because movement of K+ into the mitochondrial compartments will '
 'disrupt proton movement into the intermembrane space.',
 'increase, because the net positive charge in the mitochondria will cause '
 'increased movement of protons into the intermembrane space.',
 'increase, because the additional positive charge will further activate ATP '
 'synthetase']
decrease, because movement of K+ into the mitochondrial compartments will disrupt proton movement into the intermembrane space. 

Any disruption of the mitochondria will likely decrease ATP production. An influx of another positively charged ion into the compartment would disrupt the electrochemical gradient responsible for the necessary flow of protons.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In a laboratory population of Drosophila, all the males are XsY. Among the females, 15% are XiXi, 50% are XiXs, and 35% are XsXs. Assuming random mating, what proportion of male flies in the next generation will be XiY? 
['12%', '30%', '40%', '65%']
40%
All the males in the next generation will acquire a Y chromosome form their male parent, so the contribution of the male can be ignored. All the XiXi females will have XiY sons, so 15% of the XiY flies in the next generation will come from this type of female. Half of the sons the XiXs females produce will be XiY. Since XiXs females make up 50% of the population, 25% of the males in the next generation will come from this type of female. non of the sons of XsXs females will be XiY. So 15+25=40%

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Muscles with striated fibers are the primary muscle type in:
['the heart', 'the uterus', 'arteries and veins', 'the small intestine']
the heart 
Skeletal and cardiac muscle contain striated muscle fibers, smooth muscles do not
the heart - is cardiac muscle, striated
uterus, arteries and veins, and the small intestine are smooth muscle

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the net volume of fresh air that enters the alveoli each minute, assuming the breathing rate is 10 breaths/min, the tidal volume is 800mL/breath, and the nonalveolar respiratory system volume (dead space) is 150mL?
['5000mL', '9500mL', '6500mL', '7850 mL']
6500mL
Of the 800 mL of air that enter the lungs in a single breath (tidal volume), only 650mL reach the alveoli per breath (800mL - 150mL). Therefore the net volume of air that reaches the alveoli each minut is equal to 650mL/breath multiplied by 10 breaths/min, or 6500mL.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A drug that increases the risk of tubal pregnancy is most likely to inhibit which of the following actions?
['Contraction of the uterus',
 'Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone',
 'Onset of menstruation',
 'Transport of the ovum from ovary to uterus']
Transport of the ovum from ovary to uterus

The main reason for ectopic pregnancy is the failure of the fertilized egg to be transported from the oviducts to the uterus.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Delayed ovulation, as a cause of tubal pregnancy, would most likely be associated with delayed secretion of which of the following hormones?
['Progesterone',
 'Luteinizing hormone',
 'Estrogen',
 'Human Chorionic Growth hormone']
Luteinizing hormone because is the hormone responsible for triggering ovulation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When the environmental temperature is 33C, vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels helps to regulate the body temperature of a human by:
['slowing blood flow through the skin',
 'maintaining an even distribution of heat throughout the body',
 'radiating excess body heat into the environment',
 'reventing needed body heat from being lost to the environment']
radiating excess body heat into the environment 
When vasodilation occurs, the blood vessels relax, allowing more blood to enter the area. The presence of increased blood within dilated vasculature in cutaneous tissue allows heat to escape from the surface of the body into the environment. Vasodilation increases blood flow and facilitates heat loss.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When the environmental temperature is 45C, which of the following organisms will have the highest body temperature?
['Human', 'Kangaroo rat', 'Lizard', 'Camel']
Lizard

Kangaroo rats and Camels have great cooling mechanisms. Humans have some cooling mechanisms, while lizards have the worst cooling mechanisms because they can't sweat and can''t do vasodilation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Kidney failure during severs dehydration is most likely due to:
['inadequate blood volume for effective filtration',
 'inability to produce sufficient urine',
 'buildup of salts in the distal tubules',
 'increased body temperature']
inadequate blood volume for effective filtration 
Severe dehydration greatly reduces the volume of filtrate moving through the nephrons of the kidney. If fluid volume is too drastically reduced, the kidney will be unable to effectively do its job of filtering and maintaining homeostasis.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

People who are born without sweat glands are likely to die of heat stroke in the tropics. This indicated that, under tropical conditions, the human body may:
['gain, rather than lose, heat by evaporation',
 'gain, rather than lose, heat by radiation',
 'need to use different mechanisms than in the temperature zones to maintain '
 'body temperature',
 'be better able to regulate body temperature than under temperature '
 'conditions']
gain, rather than lose, heat by radiation
If people lack sweat glands, they are unable to make sweat nor capitalize upon the evaporative cooling of sweat. These individuals nearly solely rely on vasodilation (radiation) for responding to elevated external temperature. This indicates that radiation alone is ineffective for cooling under these conditions. In fact, the human body may gain heat by absorbing radiation from the sun leading to an elevation in body temperature.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If a person's gallbladder is removed, the person should restrict the consumption of:
['proteins', 'triglycerides', 'polysaccharides', 'lactose']
triglycerides

The gallbladder stores bile produced by the lover. The major dissolved components of bile are breakdown products of hemoglobin such as bilirubin and bile salts. Bile salts are amphipathic. Since triglycerides are hydrophobic fats, bile would aid in their digestion.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When viewing an X ray of the bones of a leg, a doctor can tell if the patient is a growing child because the X ray shows: 
['cartilaginous areas in the long bones',
 'bone cells that are actively growing',
 'the presence of haversian cells',
 'shorter than average bones']
cartilaginous areas in the long bones

Long bones grow via endochondral ossification, which requires cartilaginous growth plates at the ends of long bones, that thicken as cartilage and later become ossified.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which type of membrane receptor protein best describes receptor tyrosine kinases?
['G-Protein coupled receptor',
 'Intracellular receptor',
 'Enzyme-linked receptor',
 'Ligand-gated ion channel']
Receptor tyrosine kinases are integral membrane proteins that relay a "message" from the extracellular side of the cell to the intracellular side of the cell.

Upon activation, receptor tyrosine kinases dimerize and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on each other's tails.

This enzymatic kinase action makes receptor tyrosine kinases enzyme-linked receptors

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In human females, mitotic division of oogonia that lead to formation of presumptive egg cells (primary oocytes) occur between:
['fertilization and birth only',
 'fertilization and puberty only',
 'birth and puberty only',
 'puberty and menopause only']
fertilization and birth only
All of the mitotic divisions that form primary oocytes occur prior to birth

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A hiker becomes lost and has no drinking water for 2 days. At the end of this time, which of the following changes in hormone production would be expected to be significant in this individual?
['Decreased glucocorticoid secretion',
 'Decreased aldosterone secretion',
 'Increased insulin secretion',
 'Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion']
Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion 
Antidiuretic hormone (also called ADH or vasopressin) secretion increases in times of stress and when the osmotic pressure in the blood stream increases as it would if the blood became more concentrated due to water loss.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which participant in the electron transport chain has the greatest attraction for electrons?
['FAD', 'NAD+', 'Oxygen', 'Cytochrome c']
Oxygen
The final electron acceptor, Oxygen, has the greatest attraction for electrons

 --------------------------------------------------

['Growth hormone', 'Calcitonin', 'Thyroid hormone', 'Parathyroid hormone']
Parathyroid hormone, which is inhibited by high levels of calcium. 
Mnemonic for which hormone puts calcium into bone and which gets rid of it: Calcitonin-in parathyroid-rid

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The cells type in the male reproductive system that is most analogous to the female ovum is the:
['Spermatogonium', 'Primary spermatocyte', 'Spermatid', 'Spermatozoon']
Spermatozoon
The mature ovum is the female gamete that has completed meiosis and contains the haploid number of maternally derived chromosomes. This makes it most analogous to spermatozoa, the mature male gametes that contain the haploid number of paternally derived chromosomes.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements correctly describes the distinction between the exocrine and endocrine portions of the testis?
['The exocrine portion secretes only peptides; the endocrine portions secretes '
 'only steroids',
 'The exocrine portion releases its products into ducts; the endocrine portion '
 'releases its products into the blood',
 'The exocrine portion secretes only cellular elements; the endocrine portions '
 'secretes only chemical substances',
 'The exocrine portion is the target tissue for the products of the endocrine '
 'portion']
The exocrine portion releases its products into ducts; the endocrine portion releases its products into the blood

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the danger of giving a patient with a bacterial infection an anti-inflammatory drug?
['It may decrease endogenous antibacterial activities',
 'It may increase the platelet count',
 'It may decrease the red blood cell count',
 'It may increase the blood pressure']
It may decrease endogenous antibacterial activities
The proliferation of inflammatory cells, including T cells, B cells, and other leukocytes, helps in fighting infections. Therefore, giving an infected patient anti-inflammatory drugs has the potential to reduce their ability to fight infection.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Fever in septic shock leads to which of the following compensation mechanisms?
['Dilation of capillary beds in the skin',
 'Increased skeletal muscle activity',
 'Decreased respiration rate',
 'Decreased fluid loss']
Dilation of capillary beds in the skin
To compensate for the increased body temperature in a fever, skin capillaries dilate to dissipate heat throughout the skin.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In comparison with the wall of the right ventricle of the heart, the left ventricular wall is:
['thinner and generates a higher pressure when it contracts',
 'thinner and generates a lower pressure when it contracts',
 'thicker and generates a higher pressure when it contracts',
 'thicker and generates a lower pressure when it contracts']
thicker and generates a higher pressure when it contracts
The right ventricle pumps blood through the lungs, the left ventricle pumps blood through the entire body.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

If an artery that supplies blood to a lung lobe was blocked but ventilation to the lobe was unaffected, how would alveolar gas partial pressures change?
['Both PO2 and PCO2 would increase',
 'Both PO2 and PCO2 would decrease',
 'PO2 would increase and PCO2 would decrease',
 'PO2 would decrease and PCO2 would increase']
PO2 would increase and PCO2 would decrease
If the blood flow to an alveolus were blocked there would be no flow of hemoglobin-rich red blood cells to take away O2 and no influx of CO2 from the blood.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is incorrect regarding the genetic code?
['Three nucleotides code for a single amino acid.',
 'The code differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.',
 'There are 20 amino acids coded by the genetic code.',
 'There are more codons than the total number of amino acids.']
B. the code differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An executive of an engineering firm is very harsh to newly employed male employees. He believes that males have decreased work ethic and stamina compared to female employees. New male employees learn of these beliefs; these employees become quite anxious and in turn, produce inferior work compared to their female colleagues. This phenomenon is referred to as:
['power', 'prejudice', 'institutional discrimination', 'stereotype threat']
D. Stereotype threat
Stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon where an out-group performs worse given anxiety about a perceived stereotype.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following must be true for a dissolution reaction where the ΔH of the energy required to break the intermolecular bonds of the solute is greater than the ΔH of the energy released in the hydration of the solute?
['The dissolution reaction is exothermic.',
 'The dissolution reaction is endothermic.',
 'The dissolution reaction is endergonic.',
 'The entropy change is negative.']
B. the dissolution reaction is endothermic 
The key notes in the prompt are that there is a two step process of dissolution: breaking apart of the solute's intermolecular bonds, then the formation of intermolecular bonds (hydration) with the water. If one requires more energy than the other, there will either be a net loss or net gain of enthalpy by the system. We're told that in this case, the energy required to break the bonds (absorption of energy) is greater than the energy released during hydration, meaning this must be an endothermic reaction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

People displaced by armed conflicts in underdeveloped countries are often granted asylum in other developed countries. Sometimes they experience great difficulty adjusting to their new lifestyles. This difficulty is most likely due to:
['culture lag', 'material culture', 'culture shock', 'secularization']

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following interactions result in the specificity and tight binding of the two strands in the DNA double helix?
['London dispersion forces',
 'Covalent bonding',
 'Hydrogen bonding',
 'Dipole-dipole interactions']
C. Hydrogen Bonding

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In thin-layer chromatography using a cellulose matrix, a mobile phase with a 1:9 ratio of ethyl acetate : petroleum ether is used on the compound shown below. If a solvent ratio of 3:7 ethyl acetate : petroleum ether were used instead, what would happen to the Rf value of the compound? 
['It would increase, because the polarity of the mobile phase is increasing',
 'It would increase, because the polarity of the mobile phase is decreasing',
 'It would decrease, because the polarity of the mobile phase is increasing',
 'It would decrease, because the polarity of the mobile phase is decreasing']
A
Ethyl acetate is more polar than petroleum ether therefore the mobile phase polarity increases as the ratio changes from 1:9 to 3:7. Since the compound is relatively polar, increasing the polarity of the solvent would cause it to spend more time with the solvent than with the matrix and would increase the distance traveled by the compound. This increase in distance would therefore increase the Rf value making (A) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is true of glycogen and glucose within the body?
['The liver is the largest store of glycogen.',
 '',
 'Muscle can break down glycogen to release glucose into the bloodstream.',
 'The enzyme phosphofructokinase is a key enzyme in breaking down glycogen and '
 'releasing glucose into the bloodstream.']
B Muscle stores glycogen but the liver is the main organ which is capable of increasing circulating glucose.
 The liver contains glucose-6-phosphatase, an enzyme which allows glucose-6-phosphate to be converted into glucose, which then enters the bloodstream. Muscle tissue does not contain this enzyme and thus is unable to release glucose into circulation. Thus (B) is the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following will decrease the vapor pressure of a liquid?
['Increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules in the liquid',
 'Increase intramolecular hydrogen bonding',
 'Decrease intermolecular hydrogen bonding',
 'Decreasing temperature of the liquid']
D
Vapor pressure is the pressure of the gas that has evaporated from the liquid. At high temperatures, there is a higher vapor pressure because more molecules have the ability to break the intermolecular bonds and evaporate (think about boiling water). Thus to decrease vapor pressure, one would need to decrease temperature of the liquid.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Role-playing, as it relates to behavior change:
['results in behavior change through punishments and rewards.',
 'does not typically result in changes in attitudes.',
 'exhibits an example where attitudes affect behaviors.',
 'can have long-lasting implications in terms of self-concept and identity.']
d

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A molecule with 0 chiral centers can only have which of the following?
['a diastereomer', 'a conformational isomer', 'an enantiomer', 'an epimer']
Molecules with 0 chiral centers are unable to have diastereomers, enantiomers, or epimers because these definitions require at least a single stereocenter within the molecule. Conformational isomers, however, refer to different conformations with respect to rotations around single bonds and exist within molecules without stereocenters. Thus (B) is correct.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A tennis ball is launched upward at an angle from starting Point A. Point B is at the top of its parabolic trajectory (the highest position of the ball above the ground), and Point C is when it hits the ground. At which point in its trajectory is the ball's velocity vector changing most rapidly with respect to time? 
['Point A',
 'A point between Point A and Point C',
 'Point C',
 'The change in velocity is the same at any point in the trajectory']
D In this kinematics scenario, the change in velocity with respect to time is equal to the acceleration due to gravity (pointing downwards throughout) and it is the same at any point in the trajectory.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The walls of the digestive tract, blood vessels and urinary bladder are composed of what type of muscle?
['striated, voluntary',
 'non-striated, involuntary',
 'non-striated, voluntary',
 'striated, involuntary']
B The above organs are composed of smooth muscle, which is non-striated and contract involuntary.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Airfoils can generate lower pressures on their top surfaces than their bottom surfaces which lie at atmospheric pressure. This helps air on the bottom push the airfoil upwards. For a flying 500kg airfoil with an area of 20 m2, what is the maximum pressure on its top surface? Assume air pressure is 100 kPa. 1 Pa = 1 N/m2
['0 Pa', '250 Pa', '75000 Pa', '99750 Pa']
D The airfoil in question masses 500 kg which means it weighs 5000 N, i.e. it will require 5000 N to lift the airfoil. If it has an area of 20 m2, we can see that a force of 5000 N over the surface area gives a pressure of 5000 / 20 = 250 N/m2 minimum required to lift the airfoil. This means that the pressure below the airfoil must be at least 250 N/m2 greater than the pressure above the airfoil. If the pressure below the airfoil is 100 kPa (100,000 N/m2) then the air pressure above the airfoil must be 100,000 - 250 = 99,750 N/m2.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A gas is held in a cylindrical chamber at a pressure P. If its temperature is held constant and the radius doubles, what is its new pressure?
['P2', '2P', 'P/4', 'P/2']
c Pressure and volume are inversely related, so if the volume doubles, the pressure will halve. In this case, since the radius doubles, the cross-sectional area of the cylinder increases by r2, i.e. increases 4x. Therefore, since the volume increases by a factor of 4, the pressure decreases by a factor of 4, making (C) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Consider a biochemical reaction A to B, which is catalyzed by A-B dehydrogenase. Which of the following statements is true?
['The reaction will proceed until the enzyme concentration decreases.',
 'The reaction will be more favorable at 0 degrees C.',
 'A component of the enzyme transferred from A to B.',
 'The free energy change (delta G) of the catalyzed reaction is the same as '
 'for the uncatalyzed reaction.']
D.
-In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the rate of a reaction is increased by a decrease in the activation energy. Furthermore, enzymes are not changed or consumed during the course of the reaction. Also, the overall free energy change of the reaction, delta G, remains unchanged in the presence of an enzyme.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following statements about enzyme kinetics is false?
['An increase in the substrate concentration (at constant enzyme '
 'concentration) leads to proportional increases in the rate of the reaction.',
 'Most enzymes operating in the human body work best at a temperature of 37 '
 'degree C.',
 'An enzyme-substrate complex can either form a product or dissociate back '
 'into the enzyme and substrate.',
 'Maximal activity of many human enzymes occurs around pH 7.2.']
A.
-Most enzymes in the human body operate a maximal activity around a temperature of 37 degrees C and a pH of 7.2, which is the pH of most body fluids. In addition, as characterized by the Michaelis-Menten model, enzymes form an enzyme-substrate complex, which can either dissociate back into the enzyme and substrate or proceed to form a product. We can eliminate B, C, and D. An increase in the substrate concentration, while maintaining a constant enzyme concentration, leads to a proportional increase in the rate of the reaction only initially. However, once most of the active sites are occupied, the reaction rate levels off, regardless of further increases in substrate concentration. At high concentrations of substrate, the reaction rate approaches its maximal velocity and is no longer changed by further increases in substrate concentration. Therefore statement A is not entirely true.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At which pH would pancreatic enzymes work at maximum activity?
['5.3', '6.7', '7.2', '8.5']
D. 
-Pancreatic enzymes work optimally in the alkaline condition of the small intestine. It is not necessary to know the exact pH at which these enzymes work because the only very basic pH is seen in (D), which is 8.5.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Some enzymes require the presence of a non-protein molecule to behave catalytically. An enzyme devoid of this molecule is called a(n):
['holoenzyme', 'apoenzyme', 'coenzyme', 'zymoenzyme']
B.
-An enzyme devoid of its necessary cofactor is called an apo-enzyme and is catalytically inactive.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following factors determine an enzyme's specificity?
['The 3D shape of the active site.',
 'The Michaelis constant.',
 'The type of cofactor required for the enzyme to be active.',
 'The prosthetic group on the enzyme.']
A.
-An enzyme's specificity is determined by the 3D shape of its active site. Regardless of which theory of enzyme specificity we are discussing (lock and key or induced fit), the active site determines which substrate the enzyme will react with.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by:
['decreasing the activation energy.',
 'increasing the overall free energy of the reaction.',
 'both A and B.',
 'none of the above.']
A.
-Enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by decreasing the activation energy. They do not affect the overall free energy, delta G, of the reaction.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Bonding between atoms of an enzyme such as trypsin is best described as:
['peptide', 'saccharide', 'ionic', 'van der Waals']
A.
-Enzymes are proteins. Proteins are composed of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Choice (B) - Saccharide, is a type of bond found in polysaccharides. Choice (C) - Ionic, is a chemical bond formed through electrostatic interaction between positive and negative ions. Choice (D) may be formed in secondary or tertiary structures of an enzyme but is not as good an option as (A).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In the equation below, substrate C is an allosteric inhibitor to enzyme 1. Which of the following is another mechanism caused by substrate C?
['--> enzyme 1 --> B',
 'Irreversible inhibition',
 'Feedback enhancement',
 'Negative feedback']
D.
-By limiting the activity of enzyme 1, the rest of the pathway is slowed, which is the definition of negative feedback. Choice (A) is incorrect because there is no competition for the active site with allosteric interactions. There is not enough information for (B) to be correct because we aren't told whether the inhibition is reversible. In general, allosteric interactions are temporary. Choice (C) is incorrect because is it the opposite of what occurs when enzyme 1 activity is reduced.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When lactose hydrolyzes its substrate, lactose, which of the following occurs?
['Lactase retains it structure after the reaction.',
 'Lactose retains its structure after the reaction.',
 'Lactase increases the activation energy of the reaction.',
 'Lactose decreases the activation energy of the reaction.']
A.
-Choice (A) is correct answer because, by definition, an enzyme remains unchanged by the reaction that is catalyzes. Choice (B) is incorrect because a substrate is changed by an enzymatic reaction. Choice (C) is not true, an enzyme would decrease the activation energy. Choice (D) is also incorrect since a substrate does not affect the activation energy.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Consider the pathway:
['--1-> B',
 'an increase in [Y}.',
 'decreased activity of enzyme 4.',
 'increased activity of enzyme 6.']
A.
-Looking at the pathway, we notice that if enzyme 3 is inhibited, everything that is controlled by it will decrease in concentration and activity. That is, the concentration of D and E will eventually decrease. The activity of enzyme 4 will also decrease, because it will be acting on a decreased amount of substrate. In addition, if enzyme 3 is inhibited, more of C will be converted to X through enzyme 5. As such, the concentration of X and Y is expected to increase, as is the activity of enzyme 6. Anything before enzyme 3 should remain unaffected. Therefore, the concentration of B will remain the same.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT true regarding lymphatic cells and their function(s)? 
['. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells.',
 'Eosinophils secrete enzymes that fight against parasites.',
 'Basophils secrete the antidiuretic hormone to aid in vasodilation.',
 'B cells secrete antibodies.']
Answer: C

 Basophils secrete histamine, not ADH, as one of its functions to fight off pathogens. In doing so, the histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells (as well as some proteins), and this allows for the white blood cells to interact with pathogens present in infected tissues.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Glen brings cookies to work. Although you have not yet tasted them, you say to another coworker, "Glen is such a great guy; I'm sure these cookies are fantastic!" What type of bias is this?
['Reliance on central traits', 'Direct benefits', 'Halo effect', 'Similarity']
Answer: C

The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which judgments of an individual's character can be affected by the overall impression of the individual.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland in response to an increase in serum osmolarity. Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by a physical or functional lack of ADH and production of dilute urine. Given the symptoms of diabetes insipidus, one would expect ADH to act on:
['Na/K/Cl channels in the loop of Henle.',
 'NaCl channels in the distal convoluted tubule.',
 'H2O channels in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct.',
 'Na/H channels in the proximal tubule.']
Answer: C

ADH acts to concentrate urine by encouraging reabsorption of water in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the nephron. It has no effect on any of the other channels in choices (A), (B), and (D).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The photoelectric effect, caused when some photons and electrons collide, helps radiologists distinguish tissue types. An electron in a metal object is struck by a photon whose energy is exactly equal to the metal's work function. The electron will:
['be ejected from the atom and will move faster than its previous velocity.',
 'be ejected from the atom and move at its previous velocity.',
 'be ejected from the atom and move slower than its previous velocity.',
 'not be ejected from the atom, but will be accelerated to a greater velocity.']
Answer: C

In the photoelectric effect, an electron escapes from a metal if it is struck by a photon whose energy is at least as high as the metal's work function. After it is ejected, its kinetic energy is equal to the difference between the photon's energy and the work function. Since the photon in this question has an energy that is equal to the work function, the electron's kinetic energy after ejection will be equal to zero. This means that the energy of the photon is just enough to let the electron escape; afterward, its velocity will be approximately zero, making choice (C) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is/are function(s) of NADPH in the cell?
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
Answer: B

NADPH has three primary functions: involvement in biosynthesis of lipids and cholesterol (the precursor to steroid hormones), production of bactericidal bleach in the lysosomes of certain white blood cells, and maintenance of a supply of reduced glutathione for protection against free radical damage. Energy carriage is an important function of NADH, not NADPH.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Studying why a nod means "yes" in many cultures is most representative of which of the following sociological concepts?
['Demographic transition',
 'Conflict theory',
 'Symbolic interactionism',
 'Demographic shift']
Answer: C

Symbolic interactionism studies how individuals interact through a shared understanding of words, gestures, and other symbols. A nod is thus a symbol in many cultures that signifies "yes."

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Astronauts experience health conditions caused by living in a low-gravity (or zero-gravity) environment. Muscles atrophy and blood volume decreases. Satellite A is resting on the surface of the Earth, while satellite B is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of Re (equal to the radius of the Earth), directly over Satellite A. If B is twice as massive as A, what is the ratio of Earth's gravitational force on A to Earth's gravitational force on B?
['1/4', '1/2', '1', '2']
Answer: D

The force of gravity between two bodies given by:

F=GM1M2/ r squared

Therefore, the force of Earth on A (FAe) to Force of Earth on B (FBe) is given by:

(A) This implies that the force will be greater on Satellite B, which is not true.

(B) Ignoring the altitude difference brings you to this choice.

(C) Neglecting to square the denominator leads you to this choice

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following brain stem areas is most important in controlling breathing? 
['Hippocampus', 'Limbic system', 'Cerebellum', 'Medulla']
Answer: D

The medulla oblongata is part of the brain stem and has important cardiac and respiratory functions. It is directly involved with the autonomic functions of things such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is TRUE regarding self-actualization as argued by a humanistic psychologist? 
['Self-actualization is associated with peak experiences',
 'Self-actualization is associated with extroversion',
 'Self-actualization is innate',
 'Self-actualization is a task confined to adolescence']
Answer: C

Abraham Maslow largely contributed to the basis of humanistic psychology. And as just one of the methods in psychology used for studying and understanding personality, the humanistic approach to personality places self-actualization at the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs; moreover, becoming "fully human" is something innate to everyone.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

By weight, the adult human body is approximately 65% water, though certain tissues may have more or less water. Several samples of water are taken: one from the product of a combustion reaction, one from solid ice, and a final sample in the liquid phase. Which of the following explains/describes why all three of these samples have the molecular formula H2O?
['Constant composition',
 'Empirical formula',
 'Percent composition',
 'Steady-state']
The law of constant composition, answer choice (A), explains that any sample of a given compound will contain the same elements in fixed proportions. Though the water samples are different in phase and in source, they are all still samples of H2O. As such, they will all have a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms, and they will all contain those elements in a fixed mass ratio. In addition to being the molecular formula for water, H2O is also its empirical formula, choice (B), but this does not explain why all three samples have the same composition. The percent composition, choice (C), is also the same for all three samples, but it would be the same for any compound with an empirical formula of H2O. Finally, steady-state, choice (D), refers to the state functions of a reaction, reactant(s), or intermediate(s), which are irrelevant to this question.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is TRUE regarding unfertilized oocytes in human females?
['Unfertilized oocytes mature in the uterus',
 'Unfertilized oocytes mature in response to an increase in FSH and LH',
 'Unfertilized oocytes mature in response to an increase in gonadotropin '
 'releasing hormone (GnRH)',
 'Unfertilized oocytes mature in response to an increase in estrogen']
Answer: B

In human females, FSH stimulates the growth of a follicle and LH stimulates the production of estrogen. Once the follicle is mature, it ruptures and then releases the oocyte. The remaining cells in the follicle then develop into the corpus luteum.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

How many liters of .3M HCL can be made from a 2: stock solution of 1.5M HCL?
['10L', '12L', '6L', '20L']
Answer: A

(0.3)(V1)=(1.5)(2)
V1= 10

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hemolytic bacteria are those that are able to destroy red blood cells. A sample of blood is added to a plate of bacteria. After 48 hours, the extracellular concentration of mitochondria is observed to have increased. This finding is most consistent with which of the following statements?
['The bacteria were hemolytic, destroying red blood cells during those 48 '
 'hours.',
 'The bacteria were non-hemolytic, and some of them lysed during those 48 '
 'hours.',
 'The plate contained more than one type of bacteria.',
 'The plate contained more than one type of human cell.']
Answer: D

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In a closed system with constant temperature, pressure can be plotted against volume in a PV diagram. Given this, which of the following is NOT true?
['The amount of energy expended by the system can be estimated by an area on '
 'the graph.',
 'The relationship between pressure and volume would always be linearly '
 'decreasing.',
 'The change in internal energy is equal to 0.',
 'An appropriate example that can be plotted in this PV diagram is an ideal '
 'gas in a container (in a constant-temperature environment) which is allowed '
 'to expand slowly.']
Answer: B

A) is eliminated because the amount of energy expended (or received) by the system is work done that can be estimated by an area under the curve, as shown in the PV diagram below. (B) is correct because this relationship is not linearly decreasing, and is instead hyperbolic. (C) is eliminated because in an isothermal process (constant temperature), the internal energy is dependent on temperature. So, with temperature constant, the change in internal energy is equal to 0. Lastly, (D) is eliminated, because the example mentioned is a clear example of a process that can be plotted in a PV diagram

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Amino acids are characterized by two highly versatile functional groups. Which of the following is NOT a reaction that amino acids can undergo due to these functional groups? 
['Nucleophilic addition',
 'Esterification',
 'Amide bond formation',
 'Keto-enol tautomerism']
Answer: D

Amino acids have both a primary carboxyl group and amine group. Due to these two groups, there are a variety of reactions possible. (A) and (C) are possible, which would involve the amino acid's amine group. Lastly, (B) is possible, which would involve the amino acid's carboxylic acid group.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT an example of some form of social mobility? 
['Paul is moving into a new apartment and changes jobs as a barista from one '
 'coffee shop to another.',
 'Lauren starts off at an entry-level position at an accounting firm and moves '
 'up to senior VP level within 20 years.',
 'Stacey, a veteran TV writer, receives a 5% bonus compensation based on her '
 'salary.',
 'George is a first-generation college student with immigrant parents who '
 'worked hard labor jobs throughout their lives.']
Answer: C

All of the above are forms of social mobility, except for (C). (A) is a form of horizontal mobility, which means the mobility due to changing positions within the same social level. (B) is a form of intragenerational mobility, which means moving up (or down) the social ladder within a person's lifetime. Lastly, (D) is a form of intergenerational mobility, which is characterized by the change from one generation to the next.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A woman notices that her father has started to move his fingers in such a way that it looks like he is rolling something, despite nothing actually being there. She also notes slowed movement and a shuffling gait. Which neurotransmitter is likely to be present in decreased levels in her father's brain?
['Epinephrine', 'Histamine', 'Dopamine', 'Serotonin']
Answer: C

The symptoms indicate that the woman's father likely has Parkinson's disease. This disease is caused by decreased dopamine production in the substantia nigra

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What stage of protein synthesis does NOT require energy?
['Initiation',
 'Elongation',
 'Termination',
 'All stages of protein synthesis require energy']
Answer: D

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A researcher is testing a new molecular compound and notes that the compound is an antagonist of estrogen. If present in the body, this compound would likely: 
['block LH production and prevent ovulation.',
 'inhibit the production of GnRH.',
 'block serotonin production.',
 'prevent the formation of primary oocytes']
Answer: A

As an antagonist to estrogen, this molecular compound would interfere with ovulation. Normal levels of estrogen usually suppress the LH surge (estrogen levels are at their highest right before the LH surge). Since an antagonist of estrogen would have a similar structure, the suppression of the LH surge would continue, and ovulation would be prevented.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium refers to a population in which gene frequencies are not changing and the gene pool remains in a stable state. Which of the following conditions is necessary for this to occur?
['Small populations, because there are fewer individuals and thus, less '
 'genetic diversity',
 'Genes in a population that all confer roughly the same reproductive '
 'advantage',
 'Large amount of migration between several populations, ensuring that '
 'selection remains random',
 'Individuals with certain traits who mate more, thus keeping these traits in '
 'equilibrium']
Answer: B

Small populations, choice (A), are less likely to remain in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because they are more susceptible to random variations in allele frequencies, or genetic drift. Migration, choice (C), means that the gene pool is not in a stable state. The different populations could, for instance, be under slightly different selective pressures, and migration between populations would prevent equilibrium. If increased mating were associated with specific traits, choice (D), that would confer a reproductive advantage on those traits, thus changing the gene frequency. Only choice (B) is correct: when all genes in a population offer the same reproductive advantage, no gene will be favored by natural selection and frequencies will remain constant.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hydrocarbons with various bond orders make up biological membranes; fewer double bonds allows for tighter interactions between neighboring hydrocarbons. In which pair of hydrocarbons does each compound contain only one double bond per molecule?
['C4H10 and C2H8', 'C2H6 and C2H8', 'C4H8 and C2H4', 'C2H2 and C4H4']
Answer: C

Hydrocarbons with one double bond are alkenes, general formula CnH2n; they have twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon atoms. Choice (C) is the only pair with both hydrocarbons having twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon atoms.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Elephant seal males mate with multiple females each mating season, while females only have one mate each. What type of mating system is this?
['Polyandry', 'Polygyny', 'Monogamy', 'Promiscuity']
Answer: B

Polygamy involves a male having exclusive relationships with several females (polygyny) or a female having exclusive relationships with several males (polyandry), choice (A). Monogamy, choice (C), consists of exclusive mating relationships. Promiscuity, choice (D), refers to a member of one sex mating with any member of the opposite sex

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Your neighbor asks you to check his mail while he is out of town, and you agree. Later that day, he asks you to water his plants as well. What technique for compliance is he using in this scenario?
['Lowball technique',
 "That's-not-all technique",
 'Foot-in-the-door technique',
 'Door-in-the-face technique']
Answer: C

This is a prime example of the foot-in-the-door technique. The neighbor first asks for a small favor and, after receiving commitment, asks for a larger favor.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Some people with anxiety disorders respond to stress by hyperventilating. It is recommended that these people breathe into a paper bag and then re-breathe this air. Why is this treatment appropriate?
['Hyperventilation causes an increase in blood carbon dioxide, and breathing '
 'the air in the bag helps to readjust blood levels of carbon dioxide.',
 'Hyperventilation causes a decrease in blood carbon dioxide, and breathing '
 'the air in the bag helps to readjust blood levels of carbon dioxide.',
 'Hyperventilation causes an increase in blood oxygen, and breathing the air '
 'in the bag helps to readjust blood levels of oxygen.',
 'Hyperventilation causes a decrease in blood oxygen, and breathing the air in '
 'the bag helps to readjust blood levels of oxygen.']
Answer: B

When people hyperventilate, their respiratory rate increases. When the respiratory rate increases, more carbon dioxide is blown off. This causes a shift to the left in the bicarbonate buffer equation, and the blood becomes more alkaline. Breathing into the bag allows some of this carbon dioxide to be returned to the bloodstream in order to maintain the proper pH.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, which of the following would be the most important for a recent college graduate to accomplish?
['Figuring out what identities are most important to him or her',
 'Feeling like a contributing member of society',
 'Forming an intimate relationship with a significant other',
 'Finding a feeling of accomplishment in his or her life']
Answer: C

As a postadolescent young adult, this person would be be described by Erikson as experiencing the conflict of intimacy vs. isolation, and so forming significant relationships with others would be a primary goal. Choices (B) and (D) represent the next two stages in life (generativity vs. stagnation and integrity vs. despair, respectively), while choice (A) is the conflict that Erikson would say should have been resolved in adolescence (identity vs. role confusion).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At what point does crossing over between sister chromatids occur?
['During prophase of meiosis',
 'During prophase of mitosis',
 'During anaphase II of meiosis',
 'None of the above']
Answer: D 

This is a tricky question that requires careful reading. Crossing over is a form of genetic recombination in which homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange pieces of their genetic material. Crossing over occurs in prophase I of meiosis, and is often referred to as synapsis. However, crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes, and not between the sister chromatids of an individual chromosome. Sister chromatids are identical pieces of DNA joined at the centromere to make up one chromosome. Since crossing over doesn't occur between sister chromatids, the correct answer is (D).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At what point does crossing over of non sister chromatids occur?
['During prophase of meiosis',
 'During prophase of mitosis',
 'During anaphase II of meiosis',
 'None of the above']
Answer: A

 -------------------------------------------------- 

An elevator is descending down an elevator shaft with constant speed. The elevator is supported by a single cable. Assuming the only forces at play are the tension in the cable and the force of gravity, then: 
['the magnitude of the work done by the tension force is larger than the '
 'magnitude of the work done by gravity.',
 'the magnitude of the work done by the tension force is smaller than the '
 'magnitude of the work done by gravity.',
 'the net work done by the two forces is zero.',
 'the work done by the tension force is zero.']
Answer: C

In this simple system, the fact that the elevator is descending at a constant speed means the net work done by the two forces is zero. There is a magnitude for the work done by the tension in the cable (in the positive y-direction), and this eliminates (D). There is also a magnitude for the work done by gravity (in the negative y-direction). Due to the constant speed and equilibrium of the system presented, (A) and (B) can be eliminated.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is FALSE regarding the fight-or-flight response? 
['The fight-or-flight response can be described as being part of the '
 'sympathetic nervous system.',
 'The fight-or-flight response can cause a person to feel emotion.',
 'The fight-or-flight response involves the release of antidiuretic hormone '
 '(ADH).',
 'The fight-or-flight response can suppress the immune system.']
Answer: C

(A) is eliminated because the fight-or-flight response is classically defined as being under control of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. (B) is eliminated because the response does cause a person to feel emotion (e.g. fear, excitement). (D) is eliminated because the reaction of the response can cause the release adrenaline and cortisol, the latter which can increase suppression of the immune system. (C) is correct because ADH is not released during this response, but adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can be.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The production of ATP via cellular respiration is governed by the following balanced reaction:
['C6H12O6', 'O2', 'CO2', 'H2O']
Answer: B

you must calculate the theoretical amount of CO2 that is produced given 360 grams of C6H12O6. If all 360 grams (2 moles) of glucose initially present reacts, then 528 g (12 moles) of CO2 should theoretically be produced. 

360 g C6H12O6 x (1 mol C6H12O6 / 180 g C6H12O6) x (6 mol CO2 / 1 mol C6H12O6) x (44 g CO2 / 1 mol CO2) = 528 g CO2

Since only 440 grams of carbon dioxide are actually produced, not all of the glucose combusts. Thus, the oxygen must be the limiting reagent in this problem making answer choice B correct. Choices C and D can be eliminated because products are never limiting reagents. Since there will be leftover C6H12O6, it is not the limiting reagent, eliminating answer choice A

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In rural communities, a small economy exists between landowners through the trade of corn. Multiple families own fertile land to grow corn and make money, but some families do not have the same quality of fertile land. Families lacking fertile land have invented a stacking system that allows their corn stalks to grow higher than normal, increasing their yield per square meter. Which type of economy most closely aligns with this? 
['Socialism', 'Feudalism', 'Capitalism', 'Mixed economy']
Answer: C

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following orders carbon, silicon, and fluorine based on first ionization energies?
['Silicon > carbon > fluorine',
 'Fluorine > carbon > silicon',
 'Silicon > fluorine > carbon',
 'Carbon > fluorine > silicon']
Answer: B

Electronegativity increases as you go up and to the right in the Periodic Table. Of the three listed, fluorine is the closest element to the upper-right in the Periodic Table. The first ionization energy measures the difficulty in removing a valence electron. Because of fluorine's position and inherent electronegativity, it is very difficult to remove one of its valence electrons. Thus, fluorine will have the highest first ionization energy. Since silicon is in the row below carbon, it has an added orbital of electrons, making it slightly easier to remove an outer electron. This extra orbital (compared to carbon) results in less of an overall force of attraction between the outer electrons and nucleus. Thus, silicon will have the lowest first ionization energy.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is an example of external locus of control?
['',
 "Gretchen is no longer kept awake by her roommate's late night keyboard "
 'typing.',
 'Lauren is talking on the phone and parks her car in her driveway, '
 'accidentally leaving the headlights on. In the morning, she blames herself '
 'for not paying attention']
Answer: B

The locus of control describes where individuals place blame or praise based on events that affect them. An external locus of control tends to place blame (or praise) on other people or factors, while an internal locus of control tends to place blame (or praise) on oneself. (B) is the only answer option where the blame is placed on a factor which is external to the person

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is true regarding bipolar disorders?
['I only', 'II only', 'I and III only', 'II and III only']
Answer: B

Bipolar disorders have been shown to be highly heritable and are associated with increased levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. Bipolar I disorder can be diagnosed with a single manic episode and does not require a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder requires at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode. Cyclothymic disorder contains at least one hypomanic episode and dysthymia.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The behavior of the individuals in the Stanford prison experiment is best explained by which of the following terms?
['I only', 'III only', 'II and III only', 'II and IV only']
Answer: C

When fulfilling particular roles, an individual's behavior can be very out of character. The changing of one's behavior (and internal ideas) to match a group is called internalization conformity. This was a key part of the experiment. The experiment also involved deindividuation, the loss of self-identity in the group setting that can lead to violent behavior.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A jury member who initially feels that a strict penalty should be placed on the defendant votes for an even stricter penalty after deliberation with the other jury members. This behavior is best described by which social phenomenon?
['Social facilitation', 'Group polarization', 'Assimilation', 'Socialization']
Answer: B

The fact that individual opinions became more extreme during group discussion is explained by group polarization. The jury member initially felt that a strict penalty should be given, but this opinion became more extreme after conversation with the rest of the group.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Hyperbaric oxygen may be used as a treatment for certain types of bacterial infections. In this therapy, the patient is placed in a chamber in which the partial pressure of oxygen is significantly increased, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the patient's tissues. This treatment is most likely used for infections with:
['obligate aerobic bacteria.',
 'facultative anaerobic bacteria.',
 'aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria.',
 'obligate anaerobic bacteria.']
Answer: D

Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen and would likely be killed by such a therapy, treating the infection. The other types of bacteria listed can all survive in the presence of oxygen and would likely not be treated using this therapy.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following does NOT describe connective tissue cells?
['They account for most cells in muscles, bones, and tendons.',
 'They secrete substances to form the extracellular matrix.',
 'In organs, they tend to form the stroma.',
 'In organs, they provide support for epithelial cells.']
Answer: A

While bones and tendons are composed predominantly of connective tissue cells, muscle tissue is considered a different tissue type. Other examples of connective tissue include cartilage, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood. Connective tissue often secretes substances to form the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and elastin, eliminating choice (B). Choices (C) and (D) are essentially identical and can both be eliminated: in organs, connective tissue often forms the support structure for epithelial cells, called the stroma.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following types of nucleic acid could form the genome of a virus?
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II only', 'I, II, and III']
Answer: D

In a virus, the nucleic acid can be either DNA or RNA and—in both cases—can be either single- or double-stranded. Therefore, all of the types of nucleic acids listed here could be used for a viral genome, making choice (D) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following activities occurs in the Golgi apparatus?
['Synthesis of proteins',
 'Modification and distribution of proteins',
 'Breakdown of lipids and carbohydrates',
 'Production of ATP']
Answer: B

The Golgi apparatus consists of a stack of membrane-enclosed sacs. It receives vesicles and their contents from the endoplasmic reticulum, modifies them (through glycosylation, phosphorylation, and other mechanisms), repackages them into vesicles, and distributes them to appropriate locations in the cell. Protein synthesis occurs in ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum, eliminating choice (A). Lipid and carbohydrate breakdown takes place in the peroxisomes and cytoplasm, eliminating choice (C). ATP production occurs in the mitochondria, eliminating choice (D).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Mitochondrial DNA is:
['I only', 'II only', 'I and II only', 'I, II, and III']
Answer: C

Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from an anaerobic prokaryote engulfing an aerobic prokaryote and establishing a symbiotic relationship; therefore, mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA, is likely to be similar to bacterial DNA. Both mDNA and bacterial DNA are organized into a single circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA that can replicate during binary fission. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, while Statement III is incorrect

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a function of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum?
['Lipid synthesis',
 'Poison detoxification',
 'Protein synthesis',
 'Transport of proteins']
Answer: C

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the transport of materials throughout the cell, in lipid synthesis, and in the detoxification of drugs and poisons. Proteins from the rough ER can cross into the smooth ER, where they are secreted into cytoplasmic vesicles and transported to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, from the given choices, protein synthesis is not a function of the smooth ER, but rather of the free ribosomes or the ribosomes associated with the rough ER. Choice (C) is therefore the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

What is the main function of the nucleolus?
['Ribosomal RNA synthesis',
 'DNA replication',
 'Cell division',
 'Chromosome assembly']
Answer: A

The nucleolus (not to be confused with the nucleus in general) is a dense structure within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized. Choice (A) is therefore the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following organelles is surrounded by a single membrane?
['Lysosomes', 'Mitochondria', 'Nuclei', 'Ribosomes']
Answer: A

Lysosomes are vesicular organelles that digest material using hydrolytic enzymes. They are surrounded by a single membrane. Both mitochondria and nuclei are surrounded by double membranes, eliminating choices (B) and (C). Ribosomes must not be surrounded by membranes because they are found not only in eukaryotes, but also in prokaryotes, which lack any membrane-bound organelles, eliminating choice (D).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is NOT a difference that would allow one to distinguish a prokaryotic and a eukaryotic cell?
['Ribosomal subunit weight',
 'Presence of a nucleus',
 'Presence of a membrane on the outside surface of the cell',
 'Presence of membrane-bound organelles']
Answer: C

The main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes include: prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, while eukaryotes do, eliminating choice (B); prokaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 30S and 50S, while eukaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 40S and 60S, eliminating choice (A); and prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotes do, eliminating choice (D). The presence of a membrane on the outer surface of the cell could not distinguish a prokaryotic cell from a eukaryotic one because both gram-negative bacteria and animal cells share this feature. Thus, choice (C) is the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following does NOT contain tubulin?
['Cilia', 'Flagella', 'Microfilaments', 'Centrioles']
Answer: C

Tubulin is the primary protein in microtubules, which are responsible for the structure and movement of cilia and flagella, eliminating choices (A) and (B). Centrioles organize microtubules in the mitotic spindle, eliminating choice (D). Microfilaments are not composed of tubulin, but rather actin, making choice (C) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) enters the human body and remains dormant in the nervous system until it produces an outbreak after exposure to heat, radiation, or other stimuli. Which of the following statements correctly describes HSV?
['While it remains dormant in the nervous system, the virus is in its lytic '
 'cycle.',
 'During an outbreak, the virus is in the lysogenic cycle.',
 'Herpes simplex virus integrates itself into the DNA of the cell.',
 'The herpes simplex virus contains a tail sheath and tail fibers.']
Answer: C

Viruses can exist in either the lytic or lysogenic cycle; they may even switch between them throughout their lifetime. During the lytic cycle, the virus's DNA takes control of the host cell's genetic machinery, manufacturing numerous progeny. In the end, the host cell bursts (lyses) and releases new virions, each capable of infecting other cells. In the lysogenic cycle, viral DNA is integrated into the host cell's genome, where it can remain dormant for days or years. Either spontaneously or as a result of environmental circumstances, the provirus can reemerge and enter a lytic cycle. Thus, choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because they reverse which part of the cycle the virus is in. Choice (D) describes features of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria—not the human nervous system. Choice (C) accurately describes how HSV operates during the lysogenic cycle, making it the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Resistance to antibiotics is a well-recognized medical problem. Which mechanism(s) can account for a bacterium's ability to increase its genetic variability and thus adapt itself to different antibiotics?
['I and II only', 'I and III only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
Answer: C

Bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, an asexual process in which the progeny is identical to the parent. Therefore, Statement I does not increase genetic variability. Conjugation can be described as a sexual mating in bacteria; it is the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria that are temporarily joined. Transduction occurs when fragments of the bacterial chromosome accidentally become packaged into viral progeny produced during a viral infection and can subsequently be introduced into another bacterium by the viral vector. Therefore, both Statements II and III increase bacterial genetic variability.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A bacterial cell is noted to be resistant to penicillin. The bacterium is transferred to a colony that lacks the fertility factor, and the rest of the colony does not become resistant to penicillin. However, the penicillin-resistant cell has also started to exhibit other phenotypic characteristics, including secretion of a novel protein. Which of the following methods of bacterial recombination is NOT likely to account for this change?
['Conjugation',
 'Transformation',
 'Transduction',
 'Infection with a bacteriophage']
Answer: A

A bacterial cell that does not rapidly cause a phenotypic change in the rest of the colony is likely not F+, meaning that this cell is not able to form a sex pilus for conjugation. The expression of new phenotypic characteristics indicate that this bacterium may have acquired some quantity of genetic information, which can be acquired by either transformation, choice (B), or transduction (which occurs via bacteriophage infection), choices (C) and (D)

 -------------------------------------------------- 

In Alzheimer's disease, a protein called the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved to form a protein called β-amyloid. This protein has a β-pleated sheet structure and precipitates to form plaques in the brain. This mechanism of disease is most similar to which of the following pathogens?
['Bacteria', 'Viruses', 'Prions', 'Viroids']
Answer: C

Prions are infectious proteins that cause misfolding of other proteins. Primarily, prions cause a shift toward β-pleated sheet confirmations, which leads to decreased solubility and degradability of proteins, ultimately leading to disease. This mechanism is very similar to the one described here for Alzheimer's disease, making choice (C) the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

After infection of a cell, a viral particle must transport itself to the nucleus in order to produce viral proteins. What is the likely genomic content of the virus?
['Double-stranded DNA',
 'Double-stranded RNA',
 'Positive-sense RNA',
 'Negative-sense RNA']
Answer: A

A virus that requires transport to the nucleus in order to produce viral proteins likely requires use of nuclear RNA polymerase in order to create mRNA that can be translated to protein. Only DNA viruses require this transport before any protein can be synthesized.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is the correct sequence of the development of a mature sperm cell?
['Spermatid → spermatocyte → spermatogonium → 2° spermatocyte → spermatozoan',
 'Spermatogonium → 1° spermatocyte → 2° spermatocyte → spermatid → '
 'spermatozoan',
 'Spermatozoan → 1° spermatocyte → 2° spermatocyte → spermatogonium → '
 'spermatid',
 'Spermatogonium → 1° spermatocyte → 2° spermatocyte → spermatozoan → '
 'spermatid']
Answer: B

Diploid cells called spermatogonia differentiate into primary spermatocytes, which undergo the first meiotic division to yield two haploid secondary spermatocytes. These undergo a second meiotic division to become immature spermatids. The spermatids then undergo a series of changes leading to the production of mature sperm, or spermatozoa.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

The many steps of glycolysis all exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium between reactant and product concentrations. Which of the following actions does NOT affect the equilibrium position of a reaction?
['Adding or subtracting heat',
 'Adding or removing a catalyst',
 'Increasing or decreasing concentrations of reactants',
 'Increasing or decreasing volumes of reactants']
Answer: B

The equilibrium of a reaction can be changed by several factors. Adding or subtracting heat, choice (A), would shift the equilibrium based on the enthalpy change of the reaction. Increasing reactant concentrations would shift the equilibrium in the direction of the product, and the opposite would occur if reactant concentrations were decreased, eliminating choice (C). Changing the volume of a reactant would affect any reaction with gaseous reactants or products, eliminating choice (D). While adding or removing a catalyst would change the reaction rate, it would not change where the equilibrium lies.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Mg(OH)2 is slowly dissolved in 500 mL of 25oC water until the solution becomes fully saturated. Which of the following occurs when 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added?
['MgCl2 precipitates',
 'Mg(OH)2 precipitates',
 'Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases',
 '[H2O] increases']
Answer: D

This question is testing your understanding of solution chemistry, equilibrium, and solubility rules. In a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2, the maximum concentrations of Mg2+(aq) and OH-(aq) ions have been reached and are in equilibrium with the solubility product, as follows:

 

Mg(OH)2(s) ó Mg2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)

 

When HCl is added to the solution, the pH of the solution decreases. The additional H+ ions react with the dissolved OH- ions forming water. Thus, D is the correct answer. Magnesium chloride is soluble in water, eliminating choice A. When HCl is added, the hydroxide concentration decreases shifting the equilibrium to the right making Choice B false. The solubility product, Ksp, is a constant that varies only with temperature making choice C incorrect

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is FALSE regarding DNA replication?
['. DNA replication requires an RNA primer.',
 '',
 '.Bacteria require telomerase to complete their DNA strand synthesis.',
 '. Helicase is required prior to DNA synthesis']
Answer: C

Due to their nonlinear nature, bacterial chromosomes do not face the same issues as eukaryotic chromosomes during DNA replication. With linear eukaryotic chromosomes, the ends of chromosomes need consistent elongation in order to prevent the successive shortening of their ends. The enzyme telomerase addresses this issue by providing a template and enzyme to lengthen the linear end with each cycle of DNA replication.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is an example of group polarization? 
['On the eve of a large group project being due, Eric does not submit his '
 'portion of the team project to the rest of his teammates until the last '
 'minute.',
 'After a class discussion about a certain campus-wide ban, students who are '
 'against the ban will defend their positions far more strongly than they '
 'would have beforehand on their own.',
 'After deliberation, a jury finds themselves split on their decision despite '
 'being closer to a consensus prior to the deliberation.',
 'During a team discussion, Sarah takes the role of team leader and tries to '
 "persuade the group into a consensus for the sake of everyone's time."]
Answer: B

Group polarization is commonly seen in group-decision making. It describes the tendency for groups to reach decision that are more extreme (positive or negative) than the original positions of the individual group members. (B) showcases an example of this, since individuals are said to hold more extreme versions of their positions after a group discussion

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Primary groups differ from secondary groups in that:
['primary groups are shorter-lived than secondary groups.',
 'primary groups are larger than secondary groups.',
 'primary groups are formed of stronger bonds than secondary groups.',
 'primary groups are assigned while secondary groups are chosen.']
Answer: C

Primary groups have direct and close bonds between members, providing warm, personal, and intimate relationships to its members. Secondary groups, in contrast, form superficial bonds and tend to last for a shorter period of time.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A contentious issue in stem cell biology is whether mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into cartilage, bone, and fat tissue in vivo or if those effects are only seen in vitro. How might researchers design an experiment to confirm in vivo differentiation? 
['Inject a mouse with labeled mesenchymal stem cells that have been cultured '
 'in vitro and track the label at common sites of differentiation.',
 'Treat mice with a drug that targets mesenchymal stem cells and measure the '
 'production of bone, cartilage, and fat tissues.',
 'Mutate a line of mice to produce a label on their mesenchymal stem cells, '
 'and track the activity of the cells at common sites of differentiation.',
 'Track the population of mesenchymal stem cells in mice as they age and begin '
 'to produce less bone, cartilage, and fat tissue.']
Answer: C

 Experimental design does not always require in-depth knowledge of the contents of the experiment. Since the assertion is that differentiation may only be occurring in vitro, the use of cells that have been cultured in vitro should be avoided, even if they are being injected back into a mouse. The reason is that the cell culture conditions could alter the cell population in some way that would not happen in vivo and would thus affect the results. For this reason, (A) can be eliminated. (B) can be eliminated because there is no indication that these tissues are only produced by the mesenchymal stem cells, just that the stem cells can differentiate into those tissues. Thus if no effect is observed when the drug is administered, it could simply be the case that other cell types take over for the lack of mesenchymal stem cells. (D) can be eliminated because many other factors contribute to aging and these confounding factors would be difficult to track against the population of mesenchymal stem cells. (C) is the correct answers because it is the closes approximation to in vivo conditions with minimal manipulation of the cell conditions while still allowing direct observation of their activities in the body.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following scenarios best fits culture lag? 
['A family immigrates from a country with frequent water shortages and '
 'maintains the policy of keeping the bathtub full of water at all times.',
 'High schools relax bans on cell phone usage several years after their use '
 'among teenagers becomes commonplace.',
 'A culture with no history of exposure to technology is suddenly provided '
 'with electronics which it subsequently fails to adopt.',
 'A group of children learns how to play a new game from children in another '
 'neighborhood. The game slowly spreads across the general population.']
Answer: B

Culture lag is the catch-up or lag that a culture experiences during the adoption of new technologies. Often culture lag results in tensions from forces that resist the change. The best example of this is (B), as schools' failure to recognize the changes in the ways students use technology led to bans of the technology's use. It takes a while for those same schools to relax their bans. (A) is a better example of culture shock, but is also not a good description of culture lag because it is not representative of a technological change they are adopting. (C) is incorrect because culture lag is about how the culture responds as technology is adopted and cannot happen if the technology is not adopted. (D) is incorrect as it is not relevant to culture lag.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Excitatory estrogen receptors have been recently found on osteoblasts. During menopause, there is a sharp decrease in the amount of estrogen production. Which of the following can be expected?
['A decrease in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may lead to '
 'osteoporosis',
 'An increase in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may lead '
 'to osteoporosis',
 'A decrease in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may prevent '
 'osteoporosis',
 'An increase in the ratio of osteoclast/osteoblast activity, which may '
 'prevent osteoporosis']
Answer: B

In menopause, there is a decrease in the concentration of estrogen. Hence, there will be decreased stimulation of the osteoblasts. Since osteoblasts and osteoclasts are in constant opposition, decreased stimulation of the osteoblasts will result in an increased ratio of osteoclast to osteoblast activity. This will lead to decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption, which may lead to osteoporosis. The correct answer is (B).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is true with regard to a major depressive episode?
['It may last less than two weeks.',
 'It must involve thoughts of suicide or a suicide attempt.',
 'It may involve a decrease in sleep.',
 'It must involve feelings of sadness.']
Answer: C

Depression is marked by a period of at least two weeks in which the patient has five of nine cardinal symptoms, one of which must be depressed mood or lack of interest (anhedonia). While decreased need for sleep is commonly seen in manic episodes, it may also appear in depression as sleep disturbance is one of the nine cardinal symptoms. Not all depressed individuals are suicidal, as in choice (B). In older men, depression may often manifest as anhedonia without feelings of sadness, invalidating choice (D).

 -------------------------------------------------- 

After a brief period of intense exercise, the activity of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. This increased activity is most likely due to:
['decreased ADP.',
 'increased acetyl-CoA.',
 'increased NADH/NAD+ ratio.',
 'increased pyruvate concentration.']
Answer: D

In most biochemical pathways, only a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl-CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). After intense exercise, one would expect PDH to be highly active to generate ATP. ADP levels (choice (A)) should be high because ATP was just burned by the muscle. Acetyl-CoA (choice (B)) is an inhibitor of PDH, causing a shift of pyruvate into the gluconeogenesis pathway. A high NADH/NAD+ ratio (choice (C)) would imply that the cell is already energetically satisfied and not in need of energy, which would not be expected in intensely exercising muscle.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Conductive deafness is often caused by accumulated fluid in the middle ear inhibiting the passage of sounds to the cochlea and auditory nerve. Sensori-neural deafness is caused by damage to, or malformation of, the inner ear or auditory nerve. Which of the following are true concerning sound waves?
['I only', 'I and III only', 'II and III only', 'None of the above']
Answer: D


I. Sound waves are mechanical disturbances that are propagated through deformable material mediums.

II. Sound waves travel faster through solids than liquids. Sound waves travel faster through liquids than gases.

III. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

At what stage does dormancy occur in primary oocytes?
['Metaphase I', 'Prophase II', 'Metaphase II', 'Prophase I']
Answer: D
Primary oocytes begin the first meiotic division before birth but enter a prolonged period of dormancy during prophase I, choice (D). This dormancy lasts until puberty. Shortly before ovulation, the primary oocyte completes the first meiotic division due to an LH surge, giving rise to a secondary oocyte and a polar body. Upon ovulation, the secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division and pauses at metaphase II. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because secondary oocytes, not primary oocytes, undergo prophase II and metaphase II. Choice (A) is incorrect because the primary oocyte does not enter metaphase I until shortly before ovulation.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following trends regarding healthcare disparities has NOT been documented?
['Females are more likely to be insured than males.',
 'Primary care use is more likely among males than females.',
 'Low-income individuals have more difficulty accessing care than high-income '
 'individuals.',
 'LGBT individuals have more barriers to healthcare than heterosexuals.']
Answer: B

In comparison to females, males visit primary care doctors less frequently. All of the other trends listed here have been documented

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following is true with regard to a major depressive episode?
['It may last less than two weeks.',
 'It must involve thoughts of suicide or a suicide attempt.',
 'It may involve a decrease in sleep.',
 'It must involve feelings of sadness.']
C

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A nine-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician. Her parents describe that any time she is startled, she appears to collapse and fall asleep. She also complains of waking up in the morning unable to move. Which sleep disorder should be suspected?
['Insomnia', 'Sleep deprivation', 'Narcolepsy', 'Sleep apnea']
Answer: C

The patient and her parents are describing cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone and intrusion of REM sleep during waking hours, usually in response to a startling or emotional trigger) and sleep paralysis (an inability to move despite being awake, usually when waking up in the morning). These symptoms are highly suggestive of narcolepsy; in fact, some consider cataplexy to be pathognomonic for (absolutely indicative of) the disorder.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of the following best explains why glutamic acid is less soluble than glycine in water at a neutral pH? 
['Glutamic acid is more acidic.',
 'Glutamic acid does not dissociate in water.',
 'Glutamic acid is larger and more hydrophobic than glycine.',
 'Glutamic acid has more nitrogen atoms.']
Answer: C

Glutamic acid is only slightly soluble in water in large part due to its hydrophobic tail acidic group at the end. Although the acidic group is present, it is not strongly acidic and the hydrophobic nature of the tail outweighs any enhanced solubility effect otherwise afforded by a carboxylic acid. Thus the correct answer is (C). (B) is incorrect because some dissociation does occur. (D) is incorrect because it is untrue and the presence of nitrogen atoms does not directly impact solubility.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency can be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Patients with this disease have difficulty walking because they lose the ability to feel where their feet are in space. This represents a loss of:
['vestibular sense.',
 'kinesthetic sense.',
 'parallel processing.',
 'feature detection.']
Answer: B

Kinesthetic sense, or proprioception, refers to the ability to tell where body parts are in three-dimensional space. The sensors for proprioception are found predominantly in the muscles and joints. Loss of vestibular sense, choice (A), would also cause difficulty walking, but this would be due to a sense of dizziness or vertigo, not an inability to feel one's feet.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A particular template DNA strand (noncoding strand) is composed of 18% cytosine and 20% guanine. What percentage of its RNA transcript will contain cytosine assuming no introns are removed? 
['18%', '20%', '36%', '38%']
Answer: B

Since cytosine is present in both DNA and RNA, it should be present in the RNA transcript. From the template strand, all G nucleotides would be transcribed into C. Thus the way to determine the amount of C in the RNA transcript is to look at the amount of G that is in the template strand which was 20%. Thus (B) is the correct answer.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Exposure to endotoxin triggers a rapid immune response without requiring past exposure. The immune response is most likely mediated by:
['the innate immune system.',
 'B cells.',
 'T cells.',
 'the adaptive immune system.']
Answer: A

B cells and T cells are both part of the adaptive immune system, both of which involve more complex responses and are generally slower in responding to novel antigens. The innate immune system is a rapid response mechanism and mediates respones without requiring previous exposure to an antigen

 -------------------------------------------------- 

A Cuban-American man living in the United States has the dominant physical features of a black man. He speaks Spanish, prefers Latin foods, and listens to Latin music. His preferences are best defined through which of the following attributes?
['I only', 'II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
Answer C

Although one's dominant physical features are associated with race, this man's preferences are those of Latino ethnicity and culture. Ethnicity is a social construct that considers language, religion, nationality, and cultural factors. Culture relates to a group's way of life; the preferences listed in the question are examples of material and symbolic culture.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

When a ray of light goes from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a lower index of refraction, total internal reflection can occur if the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle. To determine the critical angle for a ray of light going from glass to air, which of the following pieces of information would be necessary to determine Θc?
['I only', 'I and II only', 'II and III only', 'I, II, and III']
C. II and III only

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Increasing the pressure of a gas can result in all of the following changes EXCEPT:
['a decrease in the velocity of the gas molecules',
 'an increase in the ratio of the molecular volume to gas volume',
 'an increase in temperature',
 'a decrease in volume']
A. a decrease in the velocity of the gas molecules

 --------------------------------------------------
