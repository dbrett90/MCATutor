The blind spot is the area where the optic nerve connects to the retina. The 'night blind spot' occurs under conditions of low light and can extend 5 to 10 degrees from the center of the person's field of view. What is the cause of the 'night blind spot'?
['Mesopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due '
 'to the lack of rods.',
 'Photopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of cones.']
Photopic vision occurs at levels of high light levels.

Mesopic vision occurs at dawn or dusk and involves both rods and cones.

Scotopic vision occurs at levels of very low light.

The fovea is dense with cones and does not contain rods.

Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due to the lack of rods.

 -------------------------------------------------- 

Which of these is the correct order to the steps of the phototransduction cascade in reaction to light?
['rod turns from on to off => turns a b']
A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell ON-center

Retinal changes confirmation => Î± unit bonds with PDE => the rod hyperpolarizes and turns OFF.

A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell on-center => activates a retinal ganglion cell.

The tympanic reflex helps prevent damage from loud sounds. How does the tensor tympani work to protect one's hearing?
['The tensor tympani loosens the tympanic membrane. This allows the vibrations '
 'to pass more easily through the ear.',
 'The tensor tympani produces sounds by vibrating. This allows the ear to '
 'adapt to loud sounds.',
 'The tensor tympani tightens the tympanic membrane. This changes the '
 'frequency of the sound to a frequency outside the range of hearing.',
 'The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. '
 'This slows down transduction.']
It is not possible to adapt to loud sound. Over time intense vibration from loud sounds causes damage to hair cells and loss of hearing.

Strong vibrations in the ear could damage the hair cells, regardless of whether they are within the audible range.

The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. This slows down transduction.

A group of employees from a local bakery are hard workers and are able to make delicious food quickly. They hear a rumor that the owner of the store is going to sell the business and that the bakery will close. Since hearing the rumor, the quality of the food and efficiency of the baking process has decreased, and the employees often spend time discussing what they would do if the rumor were true. According to Maslow's hierarchy, what are these workers currently motivated by?
['Safety needs',
 'Physiological needs',
 'Belonging needs',
 'Actualization needs']
The worker's ability to produce food is dependent on their sense of stability in the workplace.

Physiological needs are basic needs, like food, shelter, or water.

Belonging needs are needs related to acceptance and friendship.

Actualization needs are related to personal fulfillment and achievement.

Safety needs are associated with stability, security, protection, and freedom from threats. The workers are currently motivated to pursue safety needs.

What is the main difference between an individual diagnosed with bipolar I and bipolar II?
['An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never had a hypomanic episode. '
 'An individual diagnosed with bipolar I disorder has had at least one '
 'hypomanic episode.',
 'An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never had a manic episode. An '
 'individual diagnosed with bipolar I disorder has had at least one manic '
 'episode.',
 'An individual diagnosed with bipolar I has never had a manic episode. An '
 'individual diagnosed with bipolar II disorder has had at least one manic '
 'episode.',
 'An individual diagnosed with bipolar I has never had a hypomanic episode. An '
 'individual diagnosed with bipolar II disorder has had at least one manic '
 'episode']
A hypomanic episode is a period of abnormally elevated mood and abnormally increased energy lasting at least 4 consecutive days; however, the episode is not severe enough to cause impairment in functioning or to require hospitalization.

A manic episode is a period of abnormally elevated mood and abnormally increased energy lasting at least 7 consecutive days, the episode is severe enough to cause impairment in functioning or to require hospitalization

Although it is possible for an individual diagnosed with bipolar I to never experience hypomania, it is extremely unlikely.

An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never experienced a manic episode.

An individual diagnosed with bipolar II has never had a manic episode. An individual diagnosed with bipolar I disorder has had at least one manic episode.

Unlike the DSM-IV-TR, the DSM-5 makes a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders by stating that "a paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder". What does this difference in approach toward the description of paraphilic disorders imply?
['The APA is making a distinction between normative and nonnormative behavior, '
 'labeling nonnormative behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather '
 'emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, '
 'before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA has changed the description for paraphilia to allow it to cover more '
 'forms of nonnormative behavior. Labeling these behaviors as '
 'psychopathological allows more people with paraphilic disorder to obtain '
 'help.',
 'The APA believes that individuals engaging in nonnormative sexual practices '
 'have paraphilic disorders.']
The DSM-5 describes paraphilia as any intense and persistent sexual interest other than genital stimulation or fondling in phenotypically normal, physically mature, and consenting human partners. Paraphilias include sexual sadism (inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering), masochism (being humiliated, bound, or suffering), transvestic (sexually arousing cross-dressing, in addition to voyeurism (spying on others) and frotteurism (touching or rubbing genitals against a nonconsenting individual), and pedophilia (sexual focus towards children).

The APA did not change which behaviors are labeled as normative or nonnormative paraphilias, but instead focused on whether the paraphilia causes distress or impairment to the individual or others before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.

The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.

Matt and Cati discuss the reasons why they avoid driving above the speed limit. Matt says that he wants to avoid a traffic fine, while Cati says that speeding is dangerous and, if everyone did it, there would be more accidents and people would get hurt.

['Preconventional; conventional',
 'Preconventional; postconventional',
 'Conventional; preconventional',
 'Postconventional; conventional']
Preconventional; conventional

Matt's reasoning reflects a desire to avoid punishment, which reflects stage one in Kohlberg's preconventional phase (obedience). Cati's reasoning takes into account social order, reflecting stage four in the conventional phase (law and order).
