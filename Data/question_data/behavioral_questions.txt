The blind spot is the area where the optic nerve connects to the retina. The 'night blind spot' occurs under conditions of low light and can extend 5 to 10 degrees from the center of the person's field of view. What is the cause of the 'night blind spot'?
['Mesopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due '
 'to the lack of rods.',
 'Photopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of rods.',
 'Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea '
 'due to the lack of cones.']
C. Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due to the lack of rods.
Explanation:
Photopic vision occurs at levels of high light levels.

Mesopic vision occurs at dawn or dusk and involves both rods and cones.

Scotopic vision occurs at levels of very low light.

The fovea is dense with cones and does not contain rods.

Scotopic vision, used in low light, does not receive input from the fovea due to the lack of rods.

Which of these is the correct order to the steps of the phototransduction cascade in reaction to light?
['A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell off-center => activates a '
 'retinal ganglion cell.',
 'A rod turns from off to on => turns a bipolar cell on-center => the rod '
 'hyperpolarizes and turns on.',
 'A rod turns from off to on => turns a bipolar cell off-center => the rod '
 'hyperpolarizes and turns off.',
 'A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell on-center => activates a '
 'retinal ganglion cell.']
d. A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell on-center => activates a retinal ganglion cell.
Explanation:
A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell ON-center

Retinal changes confirmation => Î± unit bonds with PDE => the rod hyperpolarizes and turns OFF.

A rod turns from on to off => turns a bipolar cell on-center => activates a retinal ganglion cell.

Repeated administration of some drugs will lead to a decrease in their effectiveness, an occurrence known as drug tolerance. When this occurs, doctors may need to increase the dosage in order to continue therapy. What is true of this increase?
['The increase in dosage will be the same for different patients',
 'Drugs of a certain type will exhibit the same drug tolerance rates',
 'The dosage will increase by the same amount each time the patient reaches '
 'tolerance',
 'The dosage increase is directly proportional to the initial dose']
d. The dosage increase is directly proportional to the initial dose
Explanation:
The doctor will attempt to increase the dosage by the just noticeable difference, in order to maintain the drug's effects while avoiding toxicity.

Different individuals will react to drugs differently, and so each person will have their own threshold for drug tolerance.

The dosage increase is directly proportional to the initial dose - Weber's Law states that the difference threshold divided by the initial stimulus is a constant for that person.

The tympanic reflex helps prevent damage from loud sounds. How does the tensor tympani work to protect one's hearing?
['The tensor tympani loosens the tympanic membrane. This allows the vibrations '
 'to pass more easily through the ear.',
 'The tensor tympani produces sounds by vibrating. This allows the ear to '
 'adapt to loud sounds.',
 'The tensor tympani tightens the tympanic membrane. This changes the '
 'frequency of the sound to a frequency outside the range of hearing.',
 'The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. '
 'This slows down transduction.']
D. The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. This slows down transduction.
Explanation:
It is not possible to adapt to loud sound. Over time intense vibration from loud sounds causes damage to hair cells and loss of hearing.

Strong vibrations in the ear could damage the hair cells, regardless of whether they are within the audible range.

The tensor tympani dampens loud sounds by tightening the tympanic membrane. This slows down transduction.

Level: 3
Which of these is NOT a reason why low tones are represented near the apex, while high tones are represented near the base of the cochlea?
['The base of the basilar membrane is much stiffer than the apex.',
 'Pressure changes in the cochlea cause a peak amplitude at a certain area of '
 'the basilar membrane as a function of the frequency of the sound.',
 'The base of the basilar membrane is narrower than the apex.',
 'Pressure changes in the cochlea cause a greater stiffening at the base than '
 'the apex.']
d. Pressure changes in the cochlea cause a greater stiffening at the base than the apex.
Explanation:
The base of the basilar membrane is 100 times stiffer than the apex.

The base of the basilar membrane is three to four times more narrow than the apex.

Pressure changes in the cochlea cause a greater stiffening at the base than the apex.

A group of employees from a local bakery are hard workers and are able to make delicious food quickly. They hear a rumor that the owner of the store is going to sell the business and that the bakery will close. Since hearing the rumor, the quality of the food and efficiency of the baking process has decreased, and the employees often spend time discussing what they would do if the rumor were true. According to Maslow's hierarchy, what are these workers currently motivated by?
['Safety needs',
 'Physiological needs',
 'Belonging needs',
 'Actualization needs']
A. Safety needs
Explanation:

Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationships between operant conditioning and drive theory?
['Drive theory is associated with negative punishment.',
 'Drive theory is associated with positive punishment.',
 'Drive theory is associated with positive reinforcement.',
 'Drive theory is associated with negative reinforcement.']
d. Drive theory is associated with negative reinforcement.
Explanation:
An action that results in the increase of future behavior is reinforcement.

An action that results in the decrease of future behavior is punishment.

Positive reinforcement would involve adding a stimulus (like a reward) to increase behavior. This describes incentive theory, not drive theory.

Drive theory is associated with negative reinforcement, or the increase in behavior caused by removal of a stimulus.

An individual goes to the clinic and describes problems with voluntary motor function. He tells the doctor that he is experiencing tremors and weakness that have led to a loss of function in his ankle. After running tests, the doctor cannot find any medical reason for the symptoms which obviously cause the man significant distress and impairment in his occupation (which requires him to stand all day). The individual is referred to a psychiatrist, who shows that the symptoms lack internal consistency by having the individual perform an ankle plantar flexion test both sitting (where he displayed weakness) and then asked the individual to stand on his toes. Having ruled out all other diagnosis, the psychiatrist diagnosed him with what somatic disorder?
['. Somatic symptom disorder',
 'illness anxiety disorder',
 'Hypochondriasis',
 'Conversion disorder']
d. Conversion disorder
Explanation:
Individuals diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder are often more concerned with illness or the idea of being ill and often lack or have minimal somatic symptoms.

In somatic symptom disorder, the focus of the individual is on the high level of distress or anxiety that is disproportionate to the seriousness of the symptoms being exhibited.

The DSM-5 criteria for conversion disorder states the individual must exhibit at least one symptom of altered voluntary motor or sensory function that shows internal inconsistency, causes distress or impairment, and cannot be explained by another mental or medical disorder. The ICD-10-CM categorizes by symptom type, with weakness (or paralysis) and abnormal movement (tremor) listed as specific symptom types.

conversion disorder.

Unlike the DSM-IV-TR, the DSM-5 makes a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders by stating that "a paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder". What does this difference in approach toward the description of paraphilic disorders imply?
['The APA is making a distinction between normative and nonnormative behavior, '
 'labeling nonnormative behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather '
 'emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, '
 'before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.',
 'The APA has changed the description for paraphilia to allow it to cover more '
 'forms of nonnormative behavior. Labeling these behaviors as '
 'psychopathological allows more people with paraphilic disorder to obtain '
 'help.',
 'The APA believes that individuals engaging in nonnormative sexual practices '
 'have paraphilic disorders.']
B. The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.
Explanation:
The DSM-5 describes paraphilia as any intense and persistent sexual interest other than genital stimulation or fondling in phenotypically normal, physically mature, and consenting human partners. Paraphilias include sexual sadism (inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering), masochism (being humiliated, bound, or suffering), transvestic (sexually arousing cross-dressing, in addition to voyeurism (spying on others) and frotteurism (touching or rubbing genitals against a nonconsenting individual), and pedophilia (sexual focus towards children).

The APA did not change which behaviors are labeled as normative or nonnormative paraphilias, but instead focused on whether the paraphilia causes distress or impairment to the individual or others before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.

The APA did not change the description of paraphilic disorders, but rather emphasized that nonnormative behavior must cause distress or impairment, before labeling the behavior as psychopathological.
