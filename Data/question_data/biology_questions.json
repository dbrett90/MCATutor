Red blood cells have a disk-like shape and lose their membranous organelles, like mitochondria and nuclei, during maturation. Erythrocytes thus cannot multiply on their own and are anaerobic. Their main role is the transport of oxygen to the tissues and of the carbon dioxide to the lungs; this task is accomplished through the use of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen and limited amount of carbon dioxide.\", \"_initial_difficulty\": 2, \"_difficulty\": {\"total\": 0, \"correct\": 0}}, {\"_question\": \"Which of the correct sequence of a cardiac impulse?\", \"_choices\": [\"SA node - AV node - Purkinje fibers - bundle of His - ventricles\", \"AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - SA node - ventricles - atria\", \"SA node - atria - AV node - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles\", \"SA node - AV node - atria - bundle of His - Purkinje fibers - ventricles\"], \"_answer\": \"C.
